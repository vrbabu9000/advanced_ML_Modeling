0,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Ajay KS,Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.,"This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.. Good:. - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!. - Display is excellent with Blue light filter.. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG. - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE. - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good. - Received next day by 11 AM !. Not So Good:. - Not that thin, but ok.. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex. - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.. - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :). - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.. Feedback. - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.. Go for it without any doubt.",5.0 out of 5 stars

3,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Riddham Jain,"False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management","Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.. Cons:. 1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.. 2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.. 3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.. Pros:. 1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.. 2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.. 3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.",1.0 out of 5 stars

22,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Arsalan Khairul Bashar,A fab phone at this price!,"1. First of all let me tell you that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.. 2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.. 3. PROS.. (a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.. (b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.. (c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.. (d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.. (e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.. (f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.. (g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.. 4. CONS.. (a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.. (b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.. 5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍",5.0 out of 5 stars
23,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,R. Roy,My Real Review - M31 is Average,"Hi. I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.. Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.. 1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.. 2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.. 3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.. 4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.. 5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.. 6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.. I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.. Thanks.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.. Update 3:. Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop.

I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!. I so miss my POCO. First the pros. 1. The brand name - if you think it is one!. 2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant. 3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos. 4. Build - seems decent. Cons:. 1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying. 2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today. 3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this. 4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device. 5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device. 6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic. 7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings. 8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking. 9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.. The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates me. Anyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me now. What a waste of Money this has been",2.0 out of 5 stars

Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.. But.... Also read the rest. • PERFORMANCE. The combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.. • DISPLAY. The super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31). • BATTERY AND CHARGING. The M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.. •CAMERA. Camera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.. Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.. *CONCLUSION*. The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.. Thank you...

47,Reviewed in India on 10 March 2020,Manoj Kumar,Best Budget phone for Avg Users,It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.. Pros :. 1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself ). 2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.. 3. SAR rating - lowest one. 4. Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery ). Cons :. 1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet ). 2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great. 3. Not so great processor. Who can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.,3.0 out of 5 stars
48,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Tech Dude,Ok product for the price range,"I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.. Pros:. 1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.. 2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.. 3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.. Cons:. 1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.. 2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.. 3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.. 4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.. Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen. If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors.

The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something around 25-30%.......

Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus.

Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good.

Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.. After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging. Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.. Phone is heating too much.

So far loved it and here's my review.. My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.. The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.. Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.. So here are the pros and cons. PROS:. - Price. - Camera. - Battery. - Display. - Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.. CONS:. - Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.. - Charging could be faster. Final thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone.

Technician means they should be professional and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not.

80,Reviewed in India on 2 April 2020,J P D,BAAP of Power and features,"I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.. What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison..

81,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2020,Norek Test,"Best in class, but with a few exceptions","Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.. This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:. First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.. Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.. Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.. If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?",3.0 out of 5 stars

I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
83,Reviewed in India on 6 June 2020,Venkatesh ,Dont be hurry in buying for Samsung M31,"I bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks. I made this purchase by keeping following factors :. 1. Brand - Samsung. 2. Released in March 2020 (Felt latest model). 3. Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.. 4, Cam specs. 4. Not to a pick a Chinese product.. But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :. 1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.. 2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.. 3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.. 4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.. 5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.. Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.. I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Why would u only keep only positive reviews and delete any negative points????. Here is the thing- battry is not uoto mark.. It drains quickly.. And it takes more than 2.5 hrs say 3 hrs as per my personal experience.. Camera is good.. Battery is a nightmare if u want to keep it charging after every 2 hrs than go ahead .and last time i gave 2 stars.. But u deleted the comment so this time take the 1 star for the product..

Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.. Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage). Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100. Camera- good color production, decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.. Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr). Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products..

My one month old Galaxy M31 phone developed crack in display. It does not have any physical damage from outside. Now Samsung service center is taking Rs. 5000 to repair it. Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.. Today I called Samsung Service Center, but nobody is picking up phone. More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.. Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.. My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.. So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account..

97,Reviewed in India on 21 March 2020,bhaskar,This is an average phone just with battery backup only  and not great w r to speed and performance,"I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone. The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.. Pros:. ------. >> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.. >> Good battery backup. >> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.. Cons:. ------. >> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.. >> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality. I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.. >> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.. >> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).. >> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!. >> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.. >> This phone is not water proof at all. If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.. >> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.. >> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.. Conclusion:. -------------. An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).

The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!!

The others are described next.. Finger print reader is slow at times and one has to place the finger a couple of times to unlock the phone.. Battery Life is lower than a 3000mah. Yes, one would get a longer battery life out of this phone if left unused and that is precisely what it hasn't been purchased for.. Camera Quality is bad, very bad. The pictures are so grainy and pixelated. Had a Moto G4 plus before this and the picture quality from the camera was awesome.. Feel cheated by Samsung for palming off such poor quality device for INR 17K. I want a refund.. Amazon, I am aware that this review will go through a review by your team.

105,Reviewed in India on 5 July 2020,Amazon Customer,Worst smartphone experience ever!,"This is the Galaxy M31 review after a week use.. Bought this phone to replace my existing iPhone SE after watching so many videos of tech reviews which are continuously bashing Apple for providing low specs mobiles. After a week, I realised that I made severe mistake by acknowledging their words. The 64 MP camera is nowhere near my 4 year old iPhone’s 12 MP camera. Macro camera is another joke in this package.. Performance: Galaxy M31 has ‘so called’ 6 GB RAM but works like 100MB RAM device. 3 GB RAM will always be occupied and you can’t do anything about that. Say what, you are free to use 3 GB RAM only. Even my Windows 10 OS use only 1.5 GB RAM. And even my older Moto E ( yes, Moto E) works better than this phone in scrolling through internet. About gaming, it’s bad joke. My 4 years old iPhone SE runs seamlessly even in 2GB RAM.. Tech people always boast about Android that it’s customisable. What customisation would serve if your phone is not even working properly? You aren’t even allowed to uninstall Netflix and they keep talking about customisations.. Battery life is pretty good though. At least they did good in this case. 6000mAh lives for 1.5 to 2 days in normal use.. Another feature provided with this phone is heating. Just some normal activities will heat up your Galaxy M31 so much that you can pretty much use it as heater in winters. Not joking here.. I bought 64 GB variant, and only 47 GB was usable. Android system is taking 13-14 GB in the system. Really?. Overall, not happy with purchase. Waste of 16.5K with this garbage product.. Samsung, you can do way better than this!!",1.0 out of 5 stars

When you play music, you can see that the volume of the song just fading off and at a point you just cannot hear any noise from the phone.. When I try to return the phone its asking to install a smart check app and only if the app says there is some defect, they would take the phone back. If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.. Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one..

107,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Lokesh Chandna,Awesome buy !! So far so good !! Heavy Duty Battery. Top specs at a reasonable price.,"I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.. This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.. Now coming to the phone :. Pros :-. 1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.. 2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.. 3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.. 4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.. 5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.. 6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.. Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.. Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :. 1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.. 2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.. 3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.. Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)",5.0 out of 5 stars

110,Reviewed in India on 14 March 2020,Amit,Superb Budget Phone by Samsung,"Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.. *Camera:. Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.. Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.. * 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.. * Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:. --> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running). --> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming. --> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network). Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.. * Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.. * Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.. * Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.. * Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).. * There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc.... --> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar). --> Personally love the Dark Mode.. Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.",4.0 out of 5 stars

118,Reviewed in India on 25 June 2020,Subhajit Bose,Detailed Review Of Samsung Galaxy M31 6 GB 128 Version GB,1.Good Camera but produces Noise in Indoor Lighting Conditions Could be Fixable through an OTA Update.. 2.Very Good Battery Life.. 3.Good Display but lacks HDR 10 support.. 4.Processor Gives Average performance compare to Qualcomm Snapdragon Processors but its sufficient for Normal People Who don't play Heavy Graphics Related Games.. 5.Physical Fingerprint Scanner is Quite Fast But An In Display Fingerprint Scanner Would Give Better Experience On This Smartphone.. 6.Software on this device is Smooth like a Butter and Packs Some Really Good Features but Real-time Network Speed Option Should Have Been Provided For Better Experience On This Device.Maybe Samsung Could provide this feature thought OTA Update Later On.. 7.This Phone Comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 but They should Provided Corning Gorilla glass 5 as other brands are providing in this price range.,5.0 out of 5 stars
119,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2020,Rahul Yadav,Fullon value  for money  .,Awesome screen .. Awesome battery .. Awesome cameras .. Specially ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung is superb. I used Samsung Galaxy alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being back to Samsung ... it's worth it .. Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing at this price . No one can beat it .. Also .. I don't play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being an experienced smartphone user i can tell ... it can run any game without lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .. Just go for it .. 1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous plastic Samsung ... it's glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case ... so it doesn't matter anyway .. 1 thing - Biometric take some time to get use to i guess.. It's a large device ... side fingerprint would have been best .. And face unlock take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security .. we have to make sure of correct angle and light .,5.0 out of 5 stars

121,Reviewed in India on 21 March 2020,Ashwin,Branded alternative for Redmi phones at this price range,Pros:. 1. Display is good especially dark images or videos look great. 2. Really a monstrous battery. 3. Selfie camera is better. 4. Fingerprint sensor is fast. 5. OS is fluidic without any lag. 6. Call quality and reception is good. 7. No ads and the default Apps can be deleted. Neutral:. 1. External speaker volume is decent but not great. Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the Nokias. Cons:. 1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.. 2. Phone is little heavy. Conclusion:. If you don't want Redmi Note series phones then this is the best branded alternative at this price point,4.0 out of 5 stars
122,Reviewed in India on 14 March 2020,Kiran,Overrated and Hyped,"Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.. Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.. RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.. Speaker voice quality is average and could be better.. The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.. Facial recognition takes a lot of time. Conclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.. However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme",2.0 out of 5 stars

124,Reviewed in India on 12 March 2020,Mayan Bhandari,Good replacement for J series in this price tag,"Fair review after one week of usage:. Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.. 2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.. 3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.. 4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.. 5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.. 6. Battery life is quite very good.. 7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.. 8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.. 9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.. Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.. 2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.. 3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.. 4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.. 5. The charging is a bit slow.. 6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.. 7. The sound output could have been more.. 8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.. 9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.. The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.",4.0 out of 5 stars

127,Reviewed in India on 25 September 2020,Raveendra,A big NOO for Samsung M Series!!! Waste of money and time! 😑,"Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on.... I wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the “quality”! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue “dot” at the left corner and grown to an “inch wide” blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.. When we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said “this is not covered under warranty” without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their “Samsung M series” mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!. We had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!! Waste of money and time 😑😑😑. It’s a clear no to buy Samsung M Series!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars

This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone. Touchscreen is too much sensitive but this sAMOLED screen is just superb, awesome and 6000mAh battery will give you a long lasting usage after one full charge. Otherwise it's an all in one phone.. The new problem which I'm facing now(after using it 2 months) is, if the data connection is on with 1st SIM and at that time if any SMS comes to 2nd SIM then the data connection get lost fully until I active the airplane mode & then deactivate it. It makes a lot of problem during banking transactions with OTPs.",4.0 out of 5 stars

They said they cannot write everything about product.. Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more..

133,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,M M ,Very good product for the price...,"The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.. The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.. After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.. I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.. Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.. For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).. In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.. I purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.. I have used the camera in the last 5 months. The results are very satisfactory. There may be some limitations in low light photography, but with a little tweaking, you get good results.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I am writing this review after using M31 for more than four month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.. BUILD QUALITY.. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite U display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on back is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.. BATTERY.. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.. CAMERA.. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.. PROCESSOR.. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.. SOUND QUALITY.. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.. Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.. 1,309 people found this helpful.

And you know what, it's turned out to be a good decision. Samsung Galaxy is an absolute beast. It looks elegant and operates smoothly with quite a lot of good quality features. I am enjoying using this mobile.. Pros:. * camera: video and image quality and available modes are too good at this price. It's good to have a 64MP camera. It works well in night light also.. * Battery life is good.. * No heating issues found while using and charging, unlike redmi mobiles.. * No need of unnecessary mandatory apps installation like in redmi.. * I feel like this mobiles GUI is amazing and better than Redmi mobiles GUI (maybe because I got bored using redmi mobiles??).. * Dolby sound system is too good. You can feel the difference if you compare audio quality with other mobile phones audio.. * Smart switch app from Samsung helps to copy all the data from your previous mobile to this one. It's a good feature.. * This mobile operates so smoothly.. *Amoled display is amazing.. Cons:. * Face unlock system sometimes fails in darkness. Samsung should have worked on this feature pre-release. But it works fine in daylight.. Overall a good experience and recommended product.. Just a suggestion, if you are buying this mobile please spend 500 more bucks and buy Spigen back cover, mobile looks elegant with it. You will love your mobile more.

156,Reviewed in India on 20 May 2020,Sahana,Overall highly satisfied with the phone,"Received the phone 20 days back. After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre-installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re pre-installed, Just one draw back which I found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.",5.0 out of 5 stars

For the last 5years I have been using mi phones though I was considering mi again I thought to try out Samsung as there are so many ads and bloat ware in mi now a days. I am blown out of the Samsung quality feel and screen quality. It’s loaded with so many usable features that made me feel I was wasting my money on some phones that were only hyped with a price tag with so much of bloat ware.. I am not a fan of large screens but still this phone with such large screen is still good to hold and operate. Strongly recommend for those looking for overall experience with slight premium.

159,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2020,Dr. Ali,"With its pros and cons, overall a good deal","I'm satisfied with the overall performance of the mobile. Battery life is excellent. Camera is fine enough and keeps good and clear pictures, provided you hold the phone for a while. Though it is not up to the mark of 64MP. At highest resolution you cannot use the zoom to take the pictures. Sound quality is clear but could be louder. Not a heavy device. Wifi connectivity is fine. Display is superb. Speed is fine but sometimes lagging make you feel that for 8GB RAM it could be better. I connected my 1TB hard drive to it and it had no problems to read it. Transfer of files can be done with OTG pendrive or external Hard drive. Fingerprint reader works fine but face reader is not that sensitive..

Hence, decided to upgrade my mother's phone as well and Samsung M series being Proudly Made in India and a non Chinese but a Korean brand, ordered the M31 128GB.. To my surprise, I was even more amazed when the phone arrived. Everything the M21 was best at, was carried over and the Camera performance was even more improved in every aspect.. The sharpness, AF, colours, and also video performance was improved over M21 which itself is good.. No wonder the phone is selling like hot cakes all over India. My only regret now is, I didnt knew the M31s was launching. Else I would have waited for the M31s which going by the reviews, is a monster in Camera segment.. Anyway, since my moms and dads phones have been set and purchased already, I think I need a phone upgrade for myself and it sure will be a Samsung.

Now after using for almost 15 days, I would say what ever is written negative in question answer section are proved wrong, I think all the negative message or answers may be because of limitations of users only.. I did not find any issues with probable questions related to Volte, Volte video Calling or anything for SIM issue or WhatsApp video calling or heating issues which was really my concern about the model and brand before purchasing the phone..

174,Reviewed in India on 10 August 2020,Balaji,Worthy Phone with amazing display,"Pros. Amazing display quality.. Top notch clarity on Amazon Prime on par with OnePlus kind of phones.. Camera quality is great in 64pixel mode back cam and 32 pixel mode front cam. Macro shot, food shot are good. Live bokeh on back cam is ok and front cam live bokeh will disappoint.. Battery backup is definitely better than a 3000 to 4000 mAh with snapdragon SOC.. General processing, speed and animations are seamless.. if you are a fan of Samsung ui you would love it.. Finger print sensor is good as the best ones , it's fast enough.. Cons. Audio quality with a Sony Bass headset is not so great, frequencies and noise cancellation is not soothing, cannot match a Nokia 6 Dolby, if you are music lover, this phone will disappoint you. Yet sound with a Bluetooth speaker was good. Surround effects on Dolby mode are good but audio quality needs some work.. I am not a fan of custom ui and someone used to the stock android & miss it, still can manage with launchers like Nova to get the stock android feel.. Has a lot of Samsung and third party apps which you have to disable. Some cannot be disabled as well. Of the 6GB, 1.5 GB is wasted on these apps. So you practically have only 3gb left after the OS and Samsung apps, which is not expected of 6gb ram device. A stock android phone will offer more RAM and processing power in reality, with the same hardware.. Exynos is worthy for normal use and I am not sure about gaming as I have not tried.. Extra memory and battery are in place because of the bloatware the phone ships in. These are not annoying like the ones on Micromax or cheaper phones. Most of these genuine ones, but one may not use them.. Larger battery makes the phone heavier, plastic body gives a false feel like the phone is not sturdy, the phone actually is pretty solid, if you have a case and glass you don't find a difference.. Over all a worthy smartphone and worth its money.",5.0 out of 5 stars

A visit from the Amazon technician who does not have practical know-how (non-techie savvy), this heating issue is normal for them as every phone heats up very surprising. They follow the apps heat output result which is not above 50C according to him, even though he can feel the heat from the phone.

182,Reviewed in India on 14 March 2020,vinay kumar vidimukkula ,Worth for every penny,"Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.. Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.. Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review. The Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.. Galaxy M31. That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.. In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.. Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review. Galaxy M31. The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.. Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.. Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review. Galaxy M31. The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.. On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The fingerprint sensor is amazing and also the face unlock is nicely responsive.

This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.. I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.. Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone",5.0 out of 5 stars
186,Reviewed in India on 8 July 2020,wasim,For display best phone in this price range,"Thanks a lot Amazon for this superb phone. After using the phone for one week I am writing down the reviews. Please go through the same it will help you.. 1:- Superb super amoled display you cannot get in this range. 5 stars. 2:-Battery - No words for battery simply awesome 5 stars. 3:- Camera :-If you have used oppo,vivo or realme then you will not like the camera quality of phone.. But if you are using it for the first time then you will like. But camera quality can be better as per this price segment.. If you are camera lover then you can go for other phones.. Macro camera is worst.. 4 stars. 4:-Performance :- Not upto the mark. Sometimes there is a lag. 3.5 stars. 5:- Games :- If you are game lover then do go for this. 3 stars. 6:- Storage :- Go with 128 GB storage option don't go for 64 GB 4 stars. So now it's your choice which option you want to go.. The charger cable which is received is of low quality and it's very loose. The packing of the phone was not that much good. Not expected from samsung. The phone was having a heavy dust on it when received.",4.0 out of 5 stars
187,Reviewed in India on 3 July 2020,Manoj k,Samsung -keep it up,After using for 5 days here r my observations. Display-crisp n top notch. Brightness-excellent. Build-plastics but sturdy. Processing- no lags or whatsoever. Compared with my opponent f7 n found better. Camera-very good. Lots of customization available. On zooming feel details could have been better.. Battery-takes long to juice up 6000mah battery. Lasts one day long on average usage.. Net speed- compared with airtel sim with oppo f7 n found upload n download speed better on opportunity. Exchange-this was my second phone purchase by exchanging old phone. The process is hassle free. Thanks to amazon. Overall impression - a phone worth buying.,4.0 out of 5 stars
188,Reviewed in India on 2 April 2020,md.salman,Critical but true!!,"Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am 💯 percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,. Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,. Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,. Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,. Display: good,. Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is 1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM cell phone.. Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.. Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,",1.0 out of 5 stars
189,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2020,Sandeep Reddy,Best in the price range,"Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.. The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies every thing is perfect.. The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.. Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.. Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.. The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.. The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.. With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.. Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung. It can't get any better than this in this price range.. So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
190,Reviewed in India on 15 December 2020,Abhishek Verma,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,"Detailed review after 2 month usage!. #DoNotBuyThisPhone. Pros-. 1. Amoled Display (Looks Great). 2. Light weight(Even after holding a battery of 6000mAh, It's not that heavy). And that's all. Cons(This is gonna be a long list)-. 1. Started lagging after 2 days even after running basic apps like Whatsapp Instagram and still lagging till today. 2. Camera quality is damn poor and slow motion in this device sucks...It skips a few frames while recording. 3. 6BG ram is just for show off...It is just 2Gb ram phone in actuality. 4. Battery Life- Monster battery? Nah! I guess this phone has only 2400mAh battery I guess, they're just fooling us!. 5. Biometrics- Face Lock is the poorest in this device, and Fingerprint scanner is just ok ok. 6. There are many more flaws in this device which I cannot discuss so kindly do purchase this brick!",2.0 out of 5 stars
191,Reviewed in India on 24 October 2020,Vijayalakshmi R,A decent phone if you buy on deep discount days. Exynos processor dissapoints,"It's a great phone to buy on Big sales or Deep discount sales days. The phone is definitely worth buying for 14k or less but not beyond that. The Exynos processor is what made me think twice. Would have beeen great if they had SD processor. Nontheless Exynos does a decent job but definitely nowhere near Qualcomm SD.. Pros. * Amoled - Display is pretty good. * Camera - Camera is extremely good for a phone priced at 14k. * Sound - Not that clear/sharp while attending calls but Ok, not bad either. * Battery - super good.. lasts 1 day on heavy use and 1.5days for normal use. cons. * Processor - Exynos instead of SD. * Battery charging - says fast charging but takes at least 2.5 hours for full charge. * Packaging - No laminated one time use screen protector (the laminated kind of sheet) is provided. Tempered glass has to be put immediately after receiving to prevent unnecessary scratches or damages.. * Silicon Cover - it would hardly cost 10/- or 20/- for the manufacturer, they should have provided a basic mobile cover. * Audio - not that great even with Samsung headphones..listening to music won't be a great experience even if you enable dolby or whatever the feature it has got. * Screen size - 6.7 inches would have been better. * Bloatware - Too many bloatware..unnecessary and annoying. Overall - It does a pretty good job. For 14k or below, just go for it... after 3months of usage:. Phone is good, got android 11 update as well... few annoying things to be noted are. 1) during calls, the hold or record button gets enabled when the ear touches the sides of the pannels. I couldn't find a way to disable this on call menu. What I do is, put the phone into home screen and lock the screen as soon as I attend the call or when my calls gets picked. 2) Bloatware - Too many bloatwares and Galaxy store updates apps of its liking. So I disbaled Galaxy store. 3) Power cord - the length of the cord is way less than cords provided by any other brands. Apart from cutting cost by providing an inferior Exynos processor samsung wanna cut cost by cutting the cord's length.. 4) Exynos is no where near SD",5.0 out of 5 stars

Didn't use the phone for couple of hours, but when picked up it was so hot like tea glass. Can u imagine ? That too back side .. cameras part. Not sure what's going on wiht the camera and battery. I am sure no app is running. All apps are closed and killed. Coming to camera, wide lens giving all funny faces. Can't imagine this kind of quality from samsung.

The battery back up is awesome. It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.. Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good..

194,Reviewed in India on 24 August 2020,Sayan Sarkar,No one can beat Samsung,An awesome product.. Value for money.. The battery is so much good that it is unbelievable. About battery I want to say something that please do charge the phone for the first time to 100% fully charge and then use the phone or else the battery life reduces.. The camera quality is awesome. Just remember to apply correct settings.. Front camera photos looks awesome.. Phone performance is also very good. Very smooth controls and the screen quality is also very good.. Sound quality is also up to the mark. The phone has an excellent sensor coordination for everything.. It also has a virtual proximity sensor and an AR support from Google with an excellent gyro sensor.. The fingerprint sensor is also very fast.. The face unlock feature is above everything.. It detects face automatically when your phone is kept upright even without turning screen on. It will detect your face and automatically turn on.. The look of the phone is also very nice with a glassy look on back.. This is a power packed phone which will always win over any phone in this price range.. I think everyone should try this experience.. I trust Samsung and still I think it is better to buy a Samsung phone than to buy other phones even if they are offering some more features.. I am very happy to write this review.. I think this review you make impact a bit.. Just stop here and buy this product.. After using it you would be feel that your decision was right..

In 6 month the screen started showing a purple patch, which grew to cover half of the screen in a week's time. The touch do not work on the purple spot on screen.. The point to note here is, I never dropped the phone or any liquid exposure.. I took the phone to samsung service center and they refused to replace screen for free even though the phone was in warranty period. They claimed there is physical damage, which I could not find from naked eyes.. Anyway I would say no because of the quality and after sales service..

No matter where you are, which network you are using, which time of the day, how good your signal strength is. You will be fed up with poor connectivity. I am not facing any network problem with my previous phone (Nokia 7+). But this crap will never connect. You will see full full signal strength, but your call will not connect, your data will not connect. You have to see the screen with frustration. Samsung support will give you some advise to change settings, but nothing will work. And i am surprised to see many such comments in the internet. I believe it is the hardware issue. I wasted my 17.5 k in this crap and using my 3 years old Nokia 7+. Dont get trapped by seeing 64 MP camera. It is of no use when there are connectivity issues.

209,Reviewed in India on 30 May 2020,Nitesh,Not just a phone it's your Need choose wisely😇,"It is a best budget phone with the amount of provided specs in it, having a massive battery of 6000mah gave me a decent backup of upto 2 days, if you are a average user then this is a phone you want, I played all types of games in it from ludo to asphalt 9 and pubg but it stood up to its name as not much of battery drain but minute lags were observed at the start but later on after few second everything got ok, adaptive brightness is very good but was not working some times had to manually set it but sometimes switching it off and on came as a solution, fingerprint sensor is quick but some times doesn't works if it is a bit dusty, also if you hands are wet it will take multiple attempts before giving access, most of the reviews I read about back panel color and material quality was negative as compared with other phones but personally i liked the color of back panel as I have the ocean blue you can call me old fashioned but there are many reasons like 1. It looks good, 2. Doesn't slips from you hand 3. Eventually you are going to use a back cover with it and etc, I have a transparent back cover over mine coz no other color would be that good as it's original, its display is one of the best as the picture quality and the color contrast and many other aspects cannot be compared with other phones in market, it also provided built in Dolby atmos when using earphone which totally changes the experience of audio while watching movies or listening songs its is just amazing, I was averagely satisfied with the camera as the night mode is not that good when compared with other phones, macro shots are very good but struggles a bit to focus, I did not find any much difference between slow mo and ultra slow mo, providing inbuilt custom stickers and emoji are good and enjoyable, speaker volume are good for a average noisy room conditions but not for listening songs outdoors, there are many gestures which takes time to get comfortable with but once you are life gets easier also there are many other features which proved helpful for day to day working environment, over all it is a best phone for average and heavy usage until and unless you are planning to play heavy games on it entire day long with heavy graphics requirement.

The most of review were said,it is good phone for a normal user.. But my experience entirely different. The main problem I am facing is : frequently the airplane mode is ON while voice call and using mobile data. And my call disconnecting in between the talk. You can imaging the situation. It had more than 100 time and some of call are official call.. Another problem is also relatively same as first, the call not connecting.if i call someone urgently call is not connecting.. Third is also related problem, since airplane mode ON automatically occasionally during payment, I had lost my money.. Fourth one is the battery not stand for 2 days.. For me (normal user : about 1-2 YouTube, 1-2 social medias ,1-2 voice call and taking all, total of 8-10 hour usage of phone (in that 5-7 hours with mobile data or wifi) get battery backup of 20-24 hours. Not expect more than that.. 5th is small problem, some app like Netflix,Facebook....cannot unistall..

I've been using this phone for about 3 days, which is enough to know how the phone performs, and this phone is sub-standard. Let me list the reasons why:. 1. To begin with the finger print scanner response is very slow. Very often it doesn't recognize the finger.. 2. With a big battery I was expecting it to.last a day. But with playing light games like Temple Run and Words wirh Friends the battery runs down very quickly. It also takes a little over 3 hours to charge fully.. 3. Camera performance is pathetic. The 64mp pics look like it's been shot with 8mph lens. And don't even try a pic at night, you won't be able to see anything with clarity.. 4. The phone feels heavy and cumbersome though it's hardly a few gms heavier than my previous phone.. 5. The volume buttons are stiff and don't respond to a normal touch.. 6. The swipe hand gesture to take a screenshot is useless as very often the screen moves along with the hand gesture of you're taking a screenshot on a webpage or Instagram or any other social media app.. And though I have more to say, I think this is enough to dissuade you from buying this phone. I'd suggest you go for either the Realme 6 or the Note 9 Pro at the same price.",2.0 out of 5 stars

218,Reviewed in India on 14 March 2020,Yash Sharma ,The best phone in this price segment.,"My review after using the phone after 4 months of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.. Pros:. 1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.. 2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.. 3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.. 4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really very good both rear as well as front.. 5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.. 6. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.. 7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).. 8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.. 9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).. 10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.. Cons:-. 1. Night mode isn’t the best.. 2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.. 3. It doesn't come with earphones.. 4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.. Conclusion:-. If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value..

219,Reviewed in India on 9 October 2020,Yash Raithatha,The phone display got damaged on its own,I am giving this review after 2 months of usage so that its helpful to other customers.. The phone's display (screen) is too brittle. My phone's display screen got damaged on it's own without any damage to the screen or body of the phone. It started with a small pink patch at the bottom and then started spreading day by day. Went to service center but they said it's not covered in the warranty and demanded Rs. 5000 to change the display.. The battery life is also not good as per the MAH which is 6000. It hardly lasts for 1 day. The charging time is also very long. I had Mi Max 2 earlier whose battery was 5300 MAH and that lasted for more than 1.5 days with the same usage. So battery life is not as marketed.. The camera quality is very good given the price range.. The fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't work.,1.0 out of 5 stars

226,Reviewed in India on 7 June 2020,Amazon Customer,Overall Good,"Its almost 3 months now. Giving review about this phone:. PROS:. 1) Made In India, in Noida factory.. 2) Very good touch screen. You don't require screen guard, as its scratch resistant/scratch free.. 3) Superb battery life.. 4) Doesn't get heated after prolonged use.. CONS:. 1) It doesn't have block number feature with prefix pattern. You have to add individual numbers. E.g. you know call starting with 140 are all advertisement calls. You can't ignore them simply by adding 140*, you have to individually add. Trucaller has this feature, but you require to install this 3rd party APP.. 2) SAMSUNG claims its a 15W charger. But if you know Wattage is Volt X Current. Its 5V, 2A charger, that is 10W. In short its weaker charger than what company claims.. 3) Its touch screen is very sensitive. If soap water etc gets on to the screen then even after cleaning by cloth, screen doesn't respond for long time. ""Accidental touch feature"" if you put ON then especially you get into this issue.. Overall:. Overall for this range with brand like SAMSUNG, its definately a good BUY. Much better than Chinese phones.",4.0 out of 5 stars

These are my observations after single day use.. 1. Rear camera quality is extraordinary unless you zoom it.. 2. Front camera isn't that great. Beauty mode is always on and photos are patchy.. 3. Samsung KNOX isn't preinstalled. So, you can't use ""Secure Folder"". Need to install ""S Secure"" app for app lock.. 4. Guesture screenshot didn't work.. 5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.. 6. OS is so smooth.. 7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.. Update: after multiple days of regular use. 1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,. 2. Though it's of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.. 3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement. 4. Call quality isn't that great. 5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well..

Good:. - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.. - Display is excellent with Blue light filter.. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG. - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.. - Camera is really good.

230,Reviewed in India on 19 October 2020,Amazon Customer,Heating on use of Camera,Phone is good except the fact that the Camera cannot be used for more than a minute as it heats up above 42 Deg C. As per Samsung heating up of mobile upto 48 DEG C is normal but refused to share the official document. They are not able to appreciate the fact that a mobile used at 24 DEG C room if heats up to 42 DEG C in one minute it is not comfortable for human use. If they can rectify this issue then the phone can be 5 Star. If not then avoid.. I took up the issue within 12 hours of purchase with Samsung and it was a pain dealing with their Service centre as they keep on dodging the issue. Quality of Samsung Service is disgusting.,3.0 out of 5 stars
231,Reviewed in India on 21 March 2020,aditi pandey,Great for camera freaks and exhaustive users ( extended battery life),"Its been 10 days since i have started using the phone. There are certain things i'd like to mention.. Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.. Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.. Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy.. We as youngsters are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.. I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Screen - please buy this , screen image quality is so good , even a dull photo looks good.. Phone looks - nothing jazzy , plain and simple. 15W charging is okay not fast types and when charging 6000 battery is like back to old school.. Sound - a bit weak but its okay if you become DJ just once in two months.. Software or bloatware - Samsung have better and useful products which all are not provided with this model as its a mid range but what all is given in not sufficient but with that kind of RAM and storage , go get how many do you like..

Performance of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities. You can lag in opening apps like outlook, gmail and any other day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing the performance lags. No worth for amount. The reason for performance is Samsung uses their own processor which slow.. After one week of usage. if the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.. Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.. Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem.

Highly reliable. It was time to change my old 3G Samsung mobile. Finally I settled for this one.. Why M31?. In my professional life, I worked on R&D, and fabrication of VLSIs. That made me a perfectionist in the field of photography. So I was looking for an affordable mobile phone as an aid to my DSLRs. This M31 met all my expectations.. The Samsung M31.. The high-resolution front and quad-camera system at the rear. Excellent exposure sytem. Brilliant colour rendition. All these through world class Samsung display..

Looks: This phone is Huge! For watching videos it is fun but handling it can be tricky... Plastic back is fingerprint magnet so cover is recommended.. Screen: stunner! Big screen + amoled is great combination! Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.. Always on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.. Battery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.. Few hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays). I am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.. Charging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%. (Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.). Performance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.. Camera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.. Attached some sample shots.. Macro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.. Wide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.. Selfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.. Video recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!. Summary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!.

After the recent Anti China sentiments like most of the Indian customwrs I was also desperately looking for a good smart phone not of Chinese origin. And yes Samsung Galaxy filled that requirement. This model Galaxy M31 is a good phone with a nice battery back up of 6000 mAH lasting for 2-3 days in normal use with fast charging capabilities. It has good quality quad camera with nice front camera. The finger print reader is very effective n prompt. It does not have unwanted forced inbuilt Apps which you can not remove unlike in Xiomi models. Also it has a dedicated SD card slot unlike the hybrid slot in Xiomi where you can either put second SIM or a card. The sound n picture quality is really good n clearly audible. With 6 GB RAM n 64 GB hard drive it can take care of all your processing n storage requirements.

It does not even last for a single day with moderate usage i.e. surfing with wifi connectivity (no gaming or watching videos).. 3. 64 mega pixel camera is another gimmick. No detailing is there. Capture is very much grainy. Pixel is also visible.. 4. Build quality is just not bearable. It gives feel similar to 7-8k phone. Cheap plastic is used in the back.. 5. Charging time is horrible. Near about 2.5 hours for full charge. It gives feel of black and white time!!. I tried several times to contact Amazon technical team but they are not responding. Hopeless!!",1.0 out of 5 stars

253,Reviewed in India on 19 August 2020,Debasrija Mondal,Great value for money,"I had been waiting to buy this smartphone since its launch. It has been a couple of days using it and I am very satisfied with the experience. The fingerprint reader unlocks the phone in a jiffy. The battery lasted over a day with moderate to high usage, including surfing, watching YouTube videos, using Spotify and making two long calls. It took me 2 hours to charge the phone from 20 to 100%, which is decent considering that the charger is a 15W one. The camera quality is really good, and although I have only taken photos of my answer scripts so far, I am looking forward to taking more photos with it. The processor is also great and it has been able to handle moderate levels of multitasking with ease. The display is bright and vibrant, and the sound quality is really good. Overall, it checks all the boxes, and makes it a true tool for the user.. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a decent budget phone. In this range it is definitely the mega monster that it claims to be.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The first and foremost reason to buy it is that its not a China brand. Had a Mi phone which stopped working after 7 months had to visit service centre to replace battery which has warranty of 6 months. Charged me Rs.1880 for it. After raise issue to Mi CS atleast they refunded my Rs. 524.. Now, about M31 if you looking for decent phone with Amoled screen and bigger battery this the phone for you.. For some people not having glass body may feel like a deal breaker but for me whi has used a glass body phone with back cover doesn't feel like much difference, phone is 90% of time in back cover.. Camera id descent for thus price range, won't say the best but gives satisfactory results and quad camera setup many more options to play with.. Samsung needs to upgrade from 9611 processor but still for a user like me it doesn't make any difference..

The delivery of Amazon was perfect. I will list down the pros and cons below:. Pros. 1. Battery life of the phone is awesome. On medium usage it lasts for 2 days. The charging time is 2.5 hours though, which a bit high for charging 6000mAh battery.. 2. Screen, colors and resolution all are a masterclass. Samsung and its screen are the best thing to have. There is some bezel in the screen and I didn't like the idea of curving screen at the corners. It is manageable though.. 3. Touch and keypad are good and responsive.. Cons. 1. Processor on the slower side. Good for its category but definitely not the best.. 2. I didn't like the build quality of the phone. While the shape is sharp and finish is good, I find the phone little bit bulky.. 3. The menu and options are not the most user friendly.

257,Reviewed in India on 10 November 2020,Krishna,"Waste of money, time and expectations. Read full review for an honest experience.","Right, to start with, let me say this in bold: ""Amazon is not a customer centric company and not a customer friendly business'. They are just acting as mediators and don't take any kind of responsibility, even though they accept that the mistake is from their end.. After a lot of research and thinking, I order this Prime Edition phone on the first day of its sale. With high expectations I received the phone and to my surprise, everything went south. Where should I start?. Brand new phone has a mic problem (assessed and agreed by Amazon technical team), though it has a 15w charger, takes 2.5 hrs time to fully charge using fast charging (want to know something funny? it take 2.6hrs to fully charge in normal mode- meaning, not in fast charging mode). And astonishingly, this must be the only phone with a 6GB RAM that can freeze on APPS, as basic as Zoom and other video calling apps - pretty exciting huh? Once I got the replacement phone, I was shocked to see similar issues in the new handset too. But this time I took a little longer to see if I can find any more issues. Apparently, this was my mistake and I should have called Amazon customer service before their 7 day return policy period to get some assistance. Because after that said time, it is customer's headache to deal with either seller or the manufacturer - literally conveyed to me by 4 members of Amazon customer service and one member from escalation team.. Yeah, so here I am stuck with a damaged or a defective phone whilst both Amazon and STPL are making profit on my money. Looks familiar? Yes, this is called cheating/looting in some areas.. Coming to the most important point, till date I've always had a good impression on Amazon for being fair but today, I have been told that 'No, Amazon is just another money making company which stands strong on their pre defined policies and cannot extend any help to a troubled customer.' I am not saying this out of anger, frustration or anything else. I am saying with my experience over the last 2-3 weeks dealing with Amazon customer care and their escalation team. Whilst Mr Edward(from escalation team) accepts their executive gave me wrong or incomplete (read as open ended) information about the return window, they also claim there is nothing they can do as the return window is automatic and there is absolutely nothing in this work they can do to help me. This in my opinion people, is purely unacceptable. They even accept that they encourage me visit the manufacturer's service center and deal with it myself during this 'PANDEMIC' with no sympathy for the trouble and risk involved even after explaining my personal condition. Kudos to your customer service and false promises. :). About the seller? they are just here to make money, nothing else. If you really want something from them, no chance in this world. You can wait for as long as you want and you'll get nothing. Absolutely nothing.. Pros:. - Screen is quite good on the mobile. - Battery does stay alive for more than a day with medium usage. - Packaging. - Delivery. Cons:. - Mic problem on the phone. - Camera is pathetic. - Phone freezes while using some apps. With a 6 GB RAM, I would say this is a disaster. - Phone heats up while charging. - It doesn't have any difference between normal charging and fast charging. - Unacceptable customer service from Amazon and seller. - Waste of time, effort and mental peace on the name of saving some hundreds of rupees",1.0 out of 5 stars

259,Reviewed in India on 5 July 2020,Prat,Service + Quality = Awesome =Amazon + Samsung,Got SG M31 more than a week ago. Ran into issues. Got in touch with CC and Tech support. They arranged a tech visit. Tech visit confirmed issues with the phone -- a replacement was done. Got a smooth working phone now and I have no complaints. Infact I want to thank all those involved in getting me a replacement.. Now for the phone itself. Big display--good display--but not HDR enabled though Vivid color setting does a pretty good job. I am not the Cheapo kind who takes selfies and uses a lot of Tik Tok so camera is not a big deal for me But the camera is real good HDR pics are nice and slow mo and time lapse are amazing. Live focus is a amazing feature in camera. Sound quality is awesome and better than redmi note 6 pro which i was using earlier. Good snappy phone for daily app usage. I don't waste my time on games so no comments. UI is good with ease of use all around. Love the AOD display.. Bought a sandisk type C usb otg but it didnt show in storage.

260,Reviewed in India on 11 August 2020,h1m@n5hu,Some issues. But buy with pride.,"Many people have written a lot about this phone. So let me give you my quick observation:. 1. Screen is good, but has yellow tint. People used to super bright screens will not like it.. 2. The max brightness is also not as much as other good quality phones.. 3. Battery life is ok at best. But that is because of Samsung os. You can enable it to kill more apps to preserve battery.. 4. Samsung one os is ok ok. Lacks many things in 2020! Scrollable wallpapers missing on home screen. Sms and calling app look outdated. App launcher is also ok ok. No issues have installed nova launcher. Can also recommend lawnchair.. 5. Sar value is low, so range is not max always. Some basic issues with wifi too. Hope samsung will fix color tint issue and other os issues.. So at almost 20k not worth it. But hey I bought it because it is not a Chinese phone. So extra money spent on nationalism. Jai Hind!",4.0 out of 5 stars

This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!. ======================================================================================. Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.. Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.. The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------. Updated after more than a month of usage:. - The phone heats up during charging.. - It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.. - Low light videos are TERRIBLE.. - Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.. - Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better..

I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone, buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly. This is huge.. So should you buy M31?

You should definitely uncheck terms and conditions for some user agreement while setting up the device be careful don't just click agree to all.. It's good for daily drive and usage.. Finger print is good no issues.. Battery is good, can use it for 2 day with minimum usage and for the entire day with high media consumption.. Camers are great from my perspective, I usually don't click that many pictures.. Touch and sensitive is good, Display is Amoled so it's great.. Speaker and call audio is average it's the main thing I dislike the most.. Charging speed is ok as this one come with 15 watts charger so the charging sppen will be between 2 to 2.5 hours or more..

I don't know if I am wrong, but it is more crisp and has better contrast.. But however I am disappointed with the battery. Even though it is 1000 mAh higher capacity, I have not noticed any significant difference over M30.. But this is again compensated by a far better camera than the M30. The M30 camera was pathetic to say the least.. This is however not as good as a realme or redmi. But, the display is light years better than the realmes or mis.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Camera 64MP main shooter is awesome, great details and color reporduction , slefie is nice too, ultra wide depth and macro works as described but main highlght is 64 MP which actualy is great.. Battery life is superb but takes 2:30+ to charge from 10 to 100.. Perfomance of 9611 is very nice, it does not lag in daily uses. PUBG in HD and ultra or HD smooth works very good for long hours of play. HDR with ultra lags sometimes. But HD ultra is the best setting for 1 hour of gaming.. Last is build quality, i have blue and i thought it might look cheap plastic as seen in pictures , but blue looks semi premium , its not thick or bulky, when u have in hand its great.. it does not have NFC so if you are in use of it then go for A51 else M31 is actualy a good deal .

My father needed a device with a large memory and ample battery life and the M31 fits the bill. However, one complaint is that the chargong is too slow, Samsung should have provided a turbo charger for a 6500 mAH battery. Charging takes more than an hour and this wait is frustrating. All other features are good. Transfer of data from previous handset was a breeze with Samsung's in-built app. Very easy to use and takes away a lot of headache if all data is transferred properly. I would recommend this handset to people who have light to medium use. Not tested the camera so won't comment on it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

286,Reviewed in India on 7 August 2020,Abhaya Kumar Pradahan,Amazing Battery backup !! Superb display !! Aggressive pricing could be reduced for Indian market.,"VALUE BUYING **** (for me). Good NON-CHINESE mobile. Overall performance is good but for INR 17500/- Processor chipset can be improved and didn't like the back design and builtin quality - can be metal. I got this mobile in the exchange for my old Redmi Note 3. So, for me value buying.. But, if you see, in this pandemic situation (COVID19) and geopolitical scenario, when India is planning to ban Chinese Products, Samsung has a great opportunity to acquire Indian Market and can deliver flagship mobiles by reducing the price.. Pros:. 1. Display. 2. Battery backup. 3. Wide-angle camera pictures. 4. Dolby Atmos is a good experience. Cons: 1. BUILTIN QUALITY (made up of plastic) -->> could be metal built. 2. As per the price range, PROCESSOR CAN BE IMPROVED.. 3. AGGRESSIVE PRICING. 4. The back should be glass. 5.

I will observe it today and than come to a conclusion.. It does not get switched on and by chance if it gets switched on than it does not read the sim card nor shows the wifi network nor the bluetooth works.Also even after putting the power off its charging logo remains on for literally minutes. Not a fault of charger as well. Not happy with the product. Is this why the phone was sold for Rs.16499 with Rs. 2000 as cashback bcoz it is faulty? First time experience a bad experience.. Good part is AMAZON HAS OFFERED TO GIVE A REPLACEMENT. Let's see how the replacement phone comes.,1.0 out of 5 stars
289,Reviewed in India on 28 October 2020,Ajit,Does what it claims .. nothing more nothing less.,"Initial Impressions after using it for a week.. People are so addicted to Chinese tripes like Pocco etc etc ..... n do not even think of looking into established brands.. At 128 GB memory Samsung is just 500Rs shy than CCP stuffs like Redmi (Infact I got the Galaxy M31 cheaper than an equivalent PRC piece). NO NO .... this doesn't boast a Snapdragon processor but has the OEM chipset which I feel, is a better choice to have the manufacturers own equipment on board ..... So here is what you get for the extra 500Rs you pay to Samsung ... everything that matters. - Very advanced phone from World class manufacturer with better specs tuned for the rest of the hardware and software. One UI gives you everything you need.. - An Amazing AMOLED display .. blows out the competition. - Precise and sharp camera in Tandem with the software (But there is a demerit on this). - A larger battery ... Equivalant Chinese ones give you 5000 mAh. - Peace of mind, with lesser bloatware , lesser trackers and Samsung patch updates for at least two years. (Most of my Samsung devices are receiving updates for three years). Misses. - Overall look and appeal ... those Pukko comes with glass which looks premium while M31's back gets shabby very soon. But there is a Positive to this ... Plastic cases are better to absorb shocks than 'Glass'tic backs .. also you can affix a good case.. - Quad Camera system is misleading ... especially the macro shooter is a total crap ... you are better off with the primary camera .. The Selfie sensor is also very good.. - No headphones with the pack ... but we already have many lying around.. - Charger supplied is of a lesser power .. I say use this one for a longer battery life. Overall ... this is good for light to moderate usage .... If you are a heavy user (aka playing processor intensive tasks) you shouldn't be looking into this range altogether.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Battery backup in average moderate usage will not last even a complete full day by the end of the your battery percentage will be around 15 to 20. Which is really disappointing. Trust me my honor 8x mobile with just 3450 mah battery gives a similar back up. What is the point of buying such a phone then. Camera is good. Low light capture is efficient enough at this price range. Finger print sensor is okay. Not great as my honor 8x has a lightning fast finger 3sensor when compared to Samsung. Also I found a sense of lag in the UI when going through the phone like pressing the back button for returning etc. Samsung need to fix the bug for battery drain its drains like crazy.

The reason given was that there was a minuscule dent at the edge of the phone (not on the screen) which was rather insignificant as everything else was proper. It's an old phone; obviously there are going to be minute scratches and dents on the edges. You can't expect an old phone in pristine condition.

300,Reviewed in India on 26 October 2020,Veerendra S.,Quite average phone at highly overpriced rate!!,"I am really not satisfied with this Samsung M31. I'll be very quick to support my claims:. 1) Camera :- I do not find the rear camera to be 64MP, nor the front to be 32MP. Image quality is not appreciable, given the images shown in commercials. Wide angle images seem to be a little distorted/stretched from the edges.. 2) Battery: I don't find the phone's battery 'up to the mark'. That cinder block battery takes around 2 hours to charge from 15% to mere 65%. So. that's annoying especially when fast charging is being advertised everywhere. Also, if you use this phone just like any normal phone, you'll end with around 20% at 8-9 pm. I guess, this tower-sized battery has been given just to support this big device. Nothing more nothing less. No doubt, it's not a 'monster!'.. 3) Size:- Gone are those days when you could find a phone within this price change that actually fits in your pocket! I mean literally! The phone is big for hands as well as the pockets. After a few days, you'll find it more of like an annoying piece of plastic ruining your day to day activities.. 4)Speaker:- The speaker (main) of this device again falls behind mark. If you are used to watching movies/shows on this big screen of phones, the speaker falls behind miserably. The sound is not even loud or crystal clear.. 5) Authenticity issues:- With just two thin stickers joining the two boxes, this is perhaps the biggest issue.. 6) Weak sensors: The portrait to landscape mode shift takes 5 to 10 seconds!!!. All in all, the phone was not at par with the price paid. The only thing I loved was the screen refresh rate.. So, it's a NO-GO for me.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I had decided to buy a phone within 20K and this phone gave me all features which are in top end phones(30K-40K), off course there is difference in the quality.. 1.Camera picture quality- Though it has nice cameras(number wise e.g 64MP,32MP) clarity of picture is not so good,but worth it in this price range.. 2.Battery- 6000 mAh it says but it isn't actually its 5825 mAH and I use a third party battery application called accu battery which is especially for battery its charging speed,health,discharging,sleep time etc. and it shows around 5400 mAH, so can't be sure of battery, though they have got a certification regarding this but am not sure.. 3.RAM- I have 8GB ram version and its worth it in this price range. Sometimes it lags but that is acceptable.. 4.Internal memory- 128GB its satisfactory, what is even better that it has a dedicated slot for memory card and since had onnem my previous device I was happy in it..

303,Reviewed in India on 25 March 2020,Lokesh,Charging the massive battery is a big problem,"The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a disappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.. A little more details after a couple of months usage. This phone needs to be little more rugged as it can crack at edges and screen very easily. An aluminum/any metal body would be much better. The battery after 2hrs 20 mins charge can easily take you through the day with above moderate usage. For heavy users, still a fast charging option may be required at the end of day. I mean who keeps phone to charge for 2+ hours? You cannot risk charge it whole night too. Samsung has produced a nice phone. It could be a game changer with some more changes.",3.0 out of 5 stars

For those complaining camera quality, I think they did not do enough research before posting, it has a decent camera with multiple modes and you will have to activate 64 MP quality manually under camera settings aspect ratio (shown in pic) which was otherwise disabled to save phone memory.. 3. FingerPrint reader works as a charm with once in a 50 miss.. 4. Coming to the battery life what I have experienced till now is 1 and a half days when 100% charged with youtube of 5-6 hours, 2 hours of calling and watching a 1.5 hours movie on Amazon Prime video app.. Will update if any degrade noticed,. Currently satisfied with battery.. 5. If you are confused between Samsung M31 and M31s, go for M31(you will save 2,000 rs.).. Each and everything is same in both- specially processor and camera and if you think about Single take Camera Feature in M31s,. Bingo! , you will get it in the OTA update right after unboxing M31..

Look for good offers as well. I got 1000 discount on icici card and bought this phone at 16499/- which is very good price for such a premium looking samsung phone.. M31 doesn't have Samsung secure folder which is there in its rival A31 phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
315,Reviewed in India on 10 August 2020,Arjun Kamath,Ineffective exchange system,"This review is for the new exchange system, which is ABSOLUTELY USELESS. The app should be logged in on the phone to be exchanged. And then after the whole procedure of exchange one should go and reset the factory settings. A lot of time is wasted and the process is so very confusing. Plus I had already reset to the factory settings so I had to download your app again and then log in and then go through the entire dumb procedure. I want to contact you using your contact us field, but there I have to go through a series of questions and I am not even able to type my query, so I am forced to put out my review here.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Camera is average failing to capture details which my Honor or OP phone did with a charm.. Cons:. Major signal issue. Many times people mentioned they are unable to reach mentioning out of coverage area/switched off which was never the case as signal levels shows full always... It's not network issue since I dont face this issue in other mobiles (same network) used in house. When researched online in forums many people mentioned the same weak signal reception and incoming call not connecting issue. This is the last thing in expected out of reputed brand like Samsung... Looks like customers are taken for ride in the name of mid budget phones. No More Samsung phone for me.!",2.0 out of 5 stars

319,Reviewed in India on 10 March 2020,subhankar r.,Ultimate Smartphone under 17K,"Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .. Pros :. 1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 17K .. 2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs . The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .. 3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .. 4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .. 5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .. 6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .. Cons :. 1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .. 2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.",5.0 out of 5 stars
320,Reviewed in India on 13 August 2020,Soli,Best value for money phone with 8gb RAM and 128gb Storage,"I received this pohne from Amazon yesterday. Let me start by saying that this phone is completely Made in India and the quality and finish is as good as any other imported phone that you will get.. The specs of the phone are simply awesome and for the price it is an excellent buy. The Amoled screen is very good and has a Gorilla Glass hence there is no need for a screen protector, but no harm if you want to put one. It is advisable to have a back cover as the finish is shiny and could be a bit slippery.. I have still not used the camera extensively but from the few pictures that I took during the daytime, they are very good.. Took early for me to comment on the battery life but it comes with an awesome 6000 mAh which lasts for a very long time. Of course this will be dependent on what you use the phone for.. It comes with a 15W fast charger. It charged the phone from 65% battery to full in little over one hour.. Transferring all your stuff from your old phone to the Samsung M30 was a simple straight forward affair using the Samsung Smart Switch. You will need to download this on your old phone from Google Play Store. I did the transfer using the wireless mode.. The specs of this phone are unbeatable for the price.",5.0 out of 5 stars

323,Reviewed in India on 16 June 2020,Aditya,Great Phone for media consumption..,"I have been using M31 from last 3 months here are some pros and cons.... Cons. •Fingerprint sensor Dose not recognise sometimes, i tried to setup it again but had same issue. But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.. • The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.. •The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.. • Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I’m noticing less lag. Just don’t get this phone for gaming the chipset isn’t good enough.. Pros. •Samsung is known for their Super Amoled. Screen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.. •On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn’t good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it’s average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.. •LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.. •This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you’re heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.. So overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using social media.... If you’re heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn’t for you. So if you don’t play graphics demanding games on your phone you will like this phone....",5.0 out of 5 stars
324,Reviewed in India on 2 July 2020,Nandan MA,Best Phone for the price,"This is a all rounder -. 1. Battery life is good, Though it would have made a little more sense if they had provided a better wattage charger then 15W. Plus side the battery life would last longer so.. 2. Camera quality is good. Though some reviews say not up to the mark - as the issue is there a separate option to use 4:3 64 MP which needs to be selected. Out of the box the default settings is 4:3 16 MP. This should help differentiate. This is in a way ok as 64 MP will use a lot of space for each picture as the size ratio is high.. 3. Display is the best as always.. 4. RAM any thing from 4 GB works well - Moderate use not talking about heavy gaming.. 5.

Worst and cheapest camera Quality I have ever seen. Selfie camera photos are reddish than actual background. After spending more than 15k we are getting cheapest camera quality. It’s simply making fools by providing 64 MP camera but actually camera sensor matters a lot. Latest Samsung M31S camera is little better. You can compare pictures taken with Rear and front Camera.

CAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!. BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.. SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.. AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top.

333,Reviewed in India on 26 October 2020,Poseidon,Good smartphone,"You will love it, if this is the phone for you. I use the phone for light gaming, YouTube, music on BT headphones, occasional long phone calls or video calls, some quick photos from time to time.. In my usage I didn't have any problems yet.. Can get through the entire using 60-70% of battery with 7+ hours of screen on time.. Light gaming is not a problem gets a little warm if using for some time.. Heavy gamers don't go for this one, specially if you are concerned about throttling or frame drops, otherwise it is okay for regular games.. Primary camera is decent no big issue after updates, I only use primary camera. Wide angle is usable but not the best. I never used macro and depth.. Secondary camera is also good at this price. Note : I disable beauty modes etc, those just make your face look weird.. Attached a same photo in regular mode, not 64 ( blacked out serial number intentionally 😃 ). I'm sure that image will compress when uploading but believe me it's good.. Audio call and network quality is good. No Bluetooth or wifi issues. Dolby Atmos is good to change the equalizer to your taste.. Display has awesome contrast and colors and you can change settings for it.. Please do buy a case, the back plastic is a fingerprint magnet. Also you don't want to drop test the beautiful screen. Build quality good, but it is not that great when compared to Nokia or Samsung S or A series.. Coming from stock android the OneUI is good, it takes some time getting used to it. Miss the haptic feedback on keyboard. Do opt out of the marketing stuff in the initial setup to get the best experience. Some oneUI features are really awesome.. On software I would caution users to read online reviews before updating the Samsung updates. Most of the updates bring good features, read before install and you will be okay..

334,Reviewed in India on 20 March 2020,DIVYA BRANWAL,A good value  of money and feature loaded product.,"The Box Contents :. The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related Papers. First Impressions :. The Package was packed well and the Samsung Box was compact.. The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.. After a week usuge:. 1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained even in bright sunlight you see the display pretty well. The viewing angles are also good. No color changes when views angles gets changed. No queries from my side.. 2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla Glass 3 protection at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared to other phones of this budget section( of course thanks to massive battery).. 3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.. 4. Front Camera: Performed well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed texture on the face(just turn off the Beauty effect) and the one of the main function is that during calls, front camera is used as ambient light sensor to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's all about the habbit that is to be developed with time.. 5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played musics of high frequency and bass, at high sound it losses it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.. The ear piece sound quality is exceptionally great.. 6. Rear Cameras: The design of Quad Cameras impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.. The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice the overall quality of normal 16MP photos are a bit rich as compared to 64MP photos as capturing image in 64MP and rendering it to 16MP increases it's quality.. The Live Focus is impressive and the blurring edge of the photos is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial lighting. I am satisfied very well.. The wide camera Performed pretty well and got satisfactory results.. I am bit disappointed with the Macro Lens that didn't performed well, however in multiple shots I got a good quality macro photo. But using main camera for macro photos gives great results.. The LED was pretty good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally well.. 7. Battery: Yes the massive 6000mAH battery is worth called massive. I got the screen-on period of 10hours in a single charge. On using it in a average way gave me around 30 hours of backup.. 8. Performance: I experienced buttery smooth performance in using it in above average usage. But I will say that you can get a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance as it doesn't got a gaming processor.. But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.. The only visible difference between M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement of secondary mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which is on the right in M30s. As a average user 60Hz display is okay for me, I didn't experienced any frame drops.. Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.. I will reccomend this product for average users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Read a few online reviews and watched couple of you tube review videos before taking the plunge. Well not disappointed so far.. Pros:. a) The screen is big and crisp in picture quality. The colors are vivid although I changed it to natural via settings as in vivid they were too bright sometimes. But that's a personal preference.. b) Battery life is good. Gives atleast 6-7 hours of SOT and will vary upon usage.. c) Having a dedicated microSD slot is a advantage when you have two sims to use.. d) The fingerprint sensor is pretty snappy in response. Haven't tried the face unlock feature yet.. e) Speaker output is good and can be heard pretty easily. Although would have preferred a stereo setup.. Cons:. a) Bit on the heavier side but can be expected due to the huge battery. Although well balanced.. b) The processor although snappy seems a bit laggy during couple of app transitions. maybe the software can be tweaked to fix this.. c) Not a gaming monster but recent games can be played at lower-mid quality depending on the title.. d) Samsung bloatware need to uninstalled....not a big fan of so many unnecessary notifications from them.. For the deal price of 17K for the 8GB variant, it was a value for money purchase and definitely a good buy. Kudos to seller and Amazon for the prompt delivery the next day.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Video edits, image edits, hours on Facebook and whatsapp, around 2 hours of calling per day. Camera is outstanding with sunlight and in medium light conditions. In very low light, the camera is average, but definitely not bad. Macro shots are amazing. 64mp option for images create crystal clear images of upto 20-25 mb size!!. There has been no lag whatsoever with multiple heavy app usage yet. Fingerprint reader is superfast and has taken more than one try to unlock only a couple of times so far, that too when my finger was moist. Build quality seems really good, i use the phones with care, but my activities are usually rough, and this phone hasnt failed. Amoled is amazing. I am using an amoled screen for the first time, and it is truly stunning.

Then I received a call letting me know that the part is not available, so they will give me a refund coupon after deducting the cost of the part thats not in stock. Okay. I got the coupon. The coupon by the way can only be redeemed at designated samsung stores and not everywhere. It is also not redeemable online. So, I went ahead and got the lesser mortal M21 deciding not to invest much in any other Samsung mobile phone. But seriously I have used Lenovo and Honor and Vivo in the past. Why would a mobile handset be so fragile in 2020! It reminds me of the time when first these kinds of smartphones were introduced and one had to be really careful. Not only that, I saw many people with M31 queuing up outside the service center. I don't think the present mega review online justifies the experience of many users.. Parting questions -. 1. Why create such a fragile phone?. 2. Why no spare parts available? Does it mean there are huge complaints already?. Dear Samsung, honestly I expected better.",1.0 out of 5 stars
345,Reviewed in India on 15 June 2020,Debashish M.,Best Samsung all rounder in July 2020,"Before zeroing in on the Samsung Galaxy M31, I researched the smartphone market in India and tabulated the data in terms of specs. For those looking to not give their money to the Chinese who are using the money to attack our country, among the Non-Chinese smartphones, the M31 presented the most bang-for-buck on paper.. The M31 really good in every department, including in its massive 6k mAh battety, its AMOLED display, Android 10 OS, 6GB of RAM, 128GB ROM, Samsung's slick UI.. At the sub 20K price range, the phone is an excellent buy.. For photographers though not so much since it does not fully support CAM2API. Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k. The 6z supports shooting in RAW as well, unlike the Samsung M31.. For the regular Joe though, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a pocket friendly Non-Chinese phone option that is compelling.. Amazon's delivered 1 day ahead of schedule.",5.0 out of 5 stars
346,Reviewed in India on 2 July 2020,Samir K.,Great option,"Detailed opinion. Fingerprint scanner- quick but you have to clean the sensor before using. Camera- selfie is ok rear camera is amazing in natural lightings but average in dark. Battery- excellent i get 3 days backup for using about 5 hrs a day of heavy to moderate usage. Screen- super colour reproduction and very responsive. Build- phone is very well balanced doesnt feel heavy and material is durable .just keep a back cover to avoid scratches. Charging- average charging time it takes 3 hrs in normal mode and about 2 hrs in fast charging mode. Speakers-decently loud but very clear. Software-one ui is the best. No bloatware,good ram management,automatic ram cleaning,and looks very neat and organised. Only one issue that it heats up a little bit while fast charging at 9volts. 1.6 amp.but at normal mode no complaints.. Very well made phone that decently handles games and gives great performance for day to day tasks like watching videos and using social media.it is made for daily use and casual gaming",5.0 out of 5 stars

348,Reviewed in India on 14 August 2020,Nikhil Singh Thakur,"Beware of M Series, read the review before you buy","Reviewing after using for 4 months. All series phones have issues such as low network and low speeds on both wifi and 4g. For example I complained to my internet provider for low wifi speed and he was able to get 40mbps on his redmi phone and M31 was not going beyond 18mbps. This is a huge failure for Samsung, similarly my cousin who bought M21 has low airtel network in the area but M21 does not catch even 1 point, other Moto and MI phones are catching 2 points. There are huge hardware issues in M series and everyone is facing this issues. Open Google and search m31 or m21 network issues and you will see thousands of complaints. Irony is Samsung is turning a blind eye on this",2.0 out of 5 stars
349,Reviewed in India on 16 February 2021,Ravi,Costly for this configuration,"Writing this review after 2 months usage.. I was a redmi user before this, so adapting to samsung took some time.. I was looking for a fone under 15k with big battery, 6gb-128gb combo and good camera. This costed 16.5k. Battery- Samsung 6000mah battery is equivalent to redmi 5000mah battery, so that has disappointed. I'm not a heavy user, but still the battery comes down to 30-35% in 24hrs. In next few months, I'll have to charge it twice a day which you don't want in a big battery fone.. Network issue- I think this is common with almost all samsung phones. Why haven't they addressed it so far, is beyond my understanding.. Camera- is good in daylight, not sure aboutlow light. People complaining about the camera quality, you need to 1st change the settings to get 64mp quality, as image with that setting will be big in size. Anyways, who clicks the pics everyday.. Touch and display - is good. I installed a safety glass on top, but threw it away after 30mins as the original feel was way too good. Back panel gets finger marks within seconds, so don't even think of using the fone without back cover.. Value for money- not really. 15000 for 6gb-128gb variant would be enough.. I know I'm yet to explore many other features in the fone, but battery, network issue and cost are unsatisfying, so I'm giving 3 stars.",3.0 out of 5 stars
350,Reviewed in India on 21 March 2020,Galvin,Best buy for the budget😁✌️,It is the best phone for the budget from a brand lik samsung all though there is small flaws lik the main 64mp cam is a wide angle lens which looks a bit odd wit a slight fish eye effect and in low lighting it produces lot of noise but u get good detailing and the colour reproduction is amazing and lastly the processor could hv been even better i feel its not that its bad now but still could hv been better overall i rate an 8/10 for the mobile and s 1 more thing u should be aware of is that it doesn't support Samsung pay and Knox. Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ✌️ continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs,4.0 out of 5 stars

Performance is not good (in comparison to MI note 7 3GB ram ₹10000 2018 phone) as its 6GB ram 2020 mobile.. 2. 64 MP Camera is only for name (cheap Chinese mobiles are far better.. 3. AI and most of UI is not upto the mark such as keyboard typing (even cheap MI has better UI and features). 4. Touch is not precise (in comparison to moto G5+ ₹10000 phone). Its hard to believe that samsung is going beat Chinese brands. Because I see a lots of improvement is required. My next mobile is not going to be Samsung.,2.0 out of 5 stars

359,Reviewed in India on 11 August 2020,Garima,Too many compromises which makes it of about no use in this range,"First of all I received the phone I was incredibly happy. It says it has 6000amper but I found it was not up to the expectations. It takes around 3:30 hr to charge completely while it should only take approx 2:30 hr,even battery drains out quickly within 8-9hours on WiFi the battery turns from 100% to 17%-this is how 6000mah works????? ofcourse not!!!!. It heats up a lot while charging like about to burst. For me it was a terrible experience ,I will not recommend anyone to purchase Samsung m31 , Samsung is a brilliant industry which makes brilliant and durable products but its only applicable to their high rated phones(above 60000rs). In the case of m31 they have too many compromises which reduces the battery efficiency,camera quality and all and you not need to waste even 17499rs for that you can get these lower performance even in the budget😉 of 6000rs,for me it's a high rated product with low I mean very low performance. Better to by any other brand products in place of using this phone by Samsung!!!!!!!. Anyways Samsung is the brilliant company but here they are making compromises in low priced products. So same your time and money both,😁😁😁😁. What's inside the box-adaptor with able,phone,warranty papers,pin and that's it😵😂. And now I don't want the product coz for me even 17499rs matters alot",1.0 out of 5 stars

Now coming to pros of the phone...even being 6000mah battery it gets charged comparitavely to other phones..speakers are awesome...fingerprint sensor works too quickly...camera captures good pictures in dim light also..processor is fantastic as it works without taking any time even if u are working on many apps at a time...",3.0 out of 5 stars

The phone I received had some issues with voice quality. It had a weird vibration and echo that use to come while talking. And calls did go blank in between. Not a network issue as I tried using multiple sim.. They scheduled a replacement after a technician visit. Same issue persisted. So may be its defect in the make.. Camera quality was pretty average. Pictures in day light were decent. Under low light the quality is horrible.. Battery life of the 1st model I received was good. Charged pretty fast too. The second one had issues of heating up and battery hardly lasted for 12 hours. Well here it took longer for the refund but have to give starsto the support team at Amazon who kept up the follow up till we got a resolution.

The major drawback is the claim made by Samsung about fast charging. Only 35-40% gets charged in one hour. So it takes almost 3 hours for full charge.

Done basic online research and I realised that both the M31 & A51 run the same processor. However M31 comes with a much bigger battery and a better camera both important features in my decision making. It's been a little over a month and I have no regrets. The phone is butter smooth in operation while I get a proper two day battery break up. The camera is sharp and produces amazing results. This is a phone for people who want a phone for basic day to day working. Emails calls browsing and reading selling with social media and watching videos all of it the phone does masterfully well. Gamers may not like this handset but they are a different segment altogether and this phone is not for that segment. I would recommend this to anyone with my eyes closed.,5.0 out of 5 stars

So after using hardly for 30 days it's gone to service centre and found issue with charging port. Brand new equipment with charging port issue??? What's next awaiting God knows.. Now can't return it, as return period is only 10 days after purchase. So stuck with this now.. Think well before investing hard earned money in this.. Dikhave pe mat jaao ....",1.0 out of 5 stars

383,Reviewed in India on 23 May 2020,steven,Overall good experience,"One serious issue i got after using it for a month, and i also read many similar comments in samsung community that is the restart issue. The phone sometimes restarts suddenly when we are still using it. And I really dont get any clue why this happens. No warnings, no reasons displayed. It just restarts suddenly..It has happens approx 6-7times during the last month.. Overall it's good. But there features which are different from what I expected.. The charger is not that slow. It's good enough.. The battery doesn't last that long as I expected. Its above average.. The position is of earphone jack is at the bottom, which is not convenient for me personally. Especially during video calls, it better to have at the top.. The RAM is 6GB but 2-3gb is pre occupied. So I suggest only go for 6GB RAM.. The loud speaker could be better in terms of quality as well as intensity of loudness.. Overall it's a very good phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars

385,Reviewed in India on 15 July 2020,jayvardhan pandey,Superb,"Its been over 3 months now with this phone. Some highlights :. 1. super amoled screen- probably the best display in the 11 to 20 k rupees segment, hands down. Much needed if are like me and you read alot on kindle etc. Having used an amoled once, won't go opt for other screens ever!. 2. Free VPN with Samsung max, so better privacy. 3. Its Made in India, and the ultimate profits go to South Korea, where samsung is headquartered (not China).. 4. A pretty low Sar value. So a much safer phone than its competitors, especially Chinese brands, in terms of the amount of radiation u are exposed to.. 5. Battery life is not that great as they proclaim to be, but it's still good.. 6. The camera is pretty good in this price range, and the front camera also does its job pretty well. (Tip- you need to change snge the default resolution of the camera to 64 mp to utilize the full power of the lens. Many people don't do this, and then they write bad about the camera). 7. A fast charger- thought not as fast as other high end phones, the charger is a good improvement from standard chargers in this price range.. 8. Much more reliable than Chinese brands, and rest assured, they won't steal your data and won't snoop on you.. What it doesn't have - an IR blaster, But that's not a big deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung is my unprecedented favorite brand and I never used any other brand. This phone is amazing in every terms !. Amazon is always giving their best when it comes to product quality and delivery time.. Buy For. • Splendid camera set-up.  Mammoth battery life.  Vivid display.  Huge in-built storage. Verdict. Samsung comes up with the upgraded variant, Samsung Galaxy M31 to line-up the segment of M series. Featuring the advanced version of its forerunner, the mid-range smartphone has an impressive quad-camera set-up, powerful device maker's chipset with 6GB RAM, large battery capacity with fast-charging functionality and an abundantly expandable in-built storage space. The phone is a viable option for users who are looking for a decent performer at a budget.. Upgraded Variant of M30. Display and Camera. The Samsung Galaxy M31 128GB gets a Super AMOLED display size of 6.4 inch (16.26cm) along with a screen resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 403ppi pixel density, which adds brilliantly vivid streaming in the device. The bezel display of the device features a waterdrop notch design to showcase the front camera set-up. For enhanced security, the HD+ display comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass v3.. Galaxy M31 features a quad-camera set-up with a 64MP primary camera supported by an 8MP ultra-wide-angled and two similar 2MP lenses. The camera features of the handset comprise of 8x Digital Zoom, HDR, panorama and portrait modes. Accompanied by an Exmor RS sensor, the front fascia sports a 32MP shooter embedded in the waterdrop notch design of the device.. Performance and Battery.

Further, it is backed-up with Mali-G72 MP3 GPU and 6GB RAM to ensure seamless performance with intensive gaming experience..

In terms of connectivity, the Galaxy M31 offers 4G Volte network, dual-SIM, USB Type-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and A-GPS with GLONASS.. Design. • Decent looks and build quality - very similar to the Samsung Galaxy M30s, with a a unibody polycarbonate design, and glossy finish on the back panel - the only major difference is the camera module which now packs a fourth camera. • The plastic body keeps the phone feeling relatively lightweight at 191 grams, which is mighty impressive for a phone packing a big 6000 mAh battery. • It also feels great to hold with a seamless curved panel that meets the display up front. • Modern, Infinity-U front - bezels around the screen are slim, except for a slightly thick chin - you still get around 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, which is great. • Fingerprint sensor at the back is easy to reach. • The power button and volumes are quite flush with the frame which means they lack that tactile, clicky feel. • Design feels a bit dated and underwhelming, there is no spark in Galaxy M31's design as we see in other brand's phones like Xiaomi and Realme. Display. • Gorgeous, 6.4-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with excellent viewing angles, and brightness levels - easily one of the best displays in the price bracket. • It also comes with ""Widevine L1"" certification, which helps stream content in crisp HD resolution. • Blacks are deep on the AMOLED display, which looks good with Night mode enabled. Software. • Samsung's OneUI is today one of the more clean, refined Android UIs that's especially well optimised for large displays like this. • One UI also brings in other useful stuff, like a System-wide Dark mode (which turns the background completely black, and looks great on the M30s' AMOLED display), and Always On Display option",5.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung has literally poured premium qualities in this phone.. 1)CAMERA - Quad Camera rich quality photos. Even after Zoom, details are very clear & No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear & stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.. 2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent & reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality & long-lasting capacity).. 3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick & so far no single glitch.. 4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass. (also depends upon on the quality of your headphones like How much it supports to this technology). 5)CALL QUALITY- Premium mic quality. Crisp & Clear voice calls. Supports almost all CODECS including Aptx. 6) RAM - Best RAM management, even after you play heavy graphics games along with complex tasks, you'll see approx 1.5gb still left. That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.. 7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience & to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance & during multitasking & Gameplay.. 8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings. Recommending to use Built-in Game Booster feature for Thriving Gaming experience along with AMOLED graphics. Just Imagine.. 9)BATTERY - 6000mAh juice will give you an output of approx 2 Days on avg use & 1 day(20hrs) on heavy usage..

Cons:. 1. Charging takes 2.5hrs which is a big drawback. Could have provided with fast charging. Charging cable is very short.. 2. Fingerprint reader at the back could have been provided in-display or side mounted which is easy to operate.. 3. 6000mah Battery lasts 1 day with heavy usage.. 4. Too many bloatware apps included. Especially amazon app added on left swipe at home screen which can't be removed or changed for any other app.. 5. Worst Night photography or photography done indoors.. 6. No EIS. No 60fps.. 7. Add some more bloatware apps from Amazon to M31 and they call it M31 prime edition, remove macro camera from M31 and call it F41. No R&D done by samsung or new features offered.

I'm writing this honest review as per my observations.. Pros -. 1. Display is very good.. Cons -. 1. Charging takes too long, from 30% to 100% charging, it took more than 2 hours.. 2. In regard to battery lasting, I don't find much difference. between my old realme 3 pro which has 4045 mah and this phone which is claimed to have 6000 mah battery. I have to charge everyday.. 3. Most irritating is while attending calls in our ears it automatically goes to onhold mode and also call recording starts automatically while placing the phone in our ear though automatic recording is off. Samsung should really work with these issues and correct the software options during calls.. 4. Finger and eyes sensor is also not so swift like my old realme 3 pro.. 5. Main Camera is also not very impressive upon comparing my old phone but yes front camera for Samsung M31 is better.. I hope Samsung will soon correct all these issues.",3.0 out of 5 stars

407,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,MAHEJABEEN AZIZUL HAQUE,Disappointed with Samsung M31 mobile as the Display got non-functional within 3 months of use.,I had a horrible experience after buying Samsung M31 immediately after it's launch. The screen display got non-functional just in three months of usage. My display got blacked out just in two minutes while I was watching video. Screen went completely black as if it's switched off. The mobile didn't have any physical damage and mishandling. There was not a single game installed and I used the mobile during lockdown just for calling and and watching videos. When I contacted the Samsung service center they called it's liquid damage called bleeding and it comes under physical damage and therefore I will have to bear the repairing charges of display change which is 5000 rs. I am really disappointed with the service and company policy where the consumer is exploited for non-functioning of mobile even though it happened on its own. Buying such an expensive mobile which doesn't work for few months is really not acceptable and company should take a note of that and act accordingly in favour of the consumer. Substandard products are being made and delivered to the customer and charged in the name of policy terms and conditions.,1.0 out of 5 stars

410,Reviewed in India on 2 August 2020,Girish,"Not so good, not so bad☺","I was one of those guys who ordered this 6/128 gb phone on day one. One of the bad phones Samsung ever made. Even after few software updates, it still restarts on its own, mostly while into a browser and sometimes in other apps. Sometimes, instead of restarting, it turns into a SAMSUNG brick, ie phone will not boot and only Samsung logo keeps on displaying for long. In this condition, you can not restart the phone with power button, you have to use RESET method. Fortunately, in this case, it only restarts and doesn't get hard reset. Battery lasts for only 4 hours of video, otherwise it's pretty good and lasts for 14-16 hours easily with normal use. Voice from earpiece had started getting deteriorate and I found that the earpiece mesh collects lot of dirt because it sits in a groove, thus vitiating voice quality. It's not waterproof (not claimed too) so if you splash water onto it expect touch to not respond and speaker volume to be extremely low for an hour or two. Though it worked perfectly after three hours of drying after I dropped it once in the water and it got submerged fully for a second or two. Samsung Swipe keyboard is little weird, many times typing wrong words. I can't say more about camera as I don't use it much. Single speaker is not bad for listening music. Fingerprint scanner is not so good, most of the time doesn't recognize. Face recognition is better than that. Still, except for the bricking part, it's a good phone for its look, screen/ resolution and hardware for this price.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Thats damm cool.. ●UI is very smooth and handy.. ●Screen quality is just awsome.. ●No heating issue in normal Usage. I have tried 13 apps running in background.(no gaming apps). ●Fingerprint reader is fast but face detection is not so fast though its good.. Cons:. ●Cam quality is not up to the mark. It has 64MP, still edge detection is not that perfect. My earlier mobile was Nokia 6.1Plus which has 16MP cam, still I find that better. Hope a soft update can fix this.. ●I prefer stock android, ANDROID ONE...anyway This UI is also good.. ● Mobile heats while gamming. This is not a gamming phone. Though I didn't play PUBG or Freefire or CALLofDUTY. Still it heats.. so no question of playing those games.. ●Charging time is too long and it don't support fast charging. 15w charger in the box and it takes nearly 2 to 3 hrs to charge this phone 0 to 100... I even tried it with Dash Charger(1plus).. still the result is same.. it has long battery so I will not complain about this as I charge it at night.",4.0 out of 5 stars
412,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2020,Anonymous,Superb battery life.,The best thing for this phone is battery life.... its superb and its lasts for 2.5 to 3 days for me.... don't use the phone for gaming though.. The ultrawide mode camera quality is good too. The only drawback is that the front camera and fingerprint sensor are not of top notch quality. Fingerprint sensor sometimes don't recognize the finger and the camera unlock is not much accurate.. Rest of the features and display quality is good too as expected in a Samsung phone.. Overall 4.5 stars.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Battery is not so great will last for one day use only.. I cannot understand the difference my M20. battery with lesser power also last the same. May be due to 64mp camera.. Capturing low wifi signal is a problem.. If you have good or average connectivity no issue. But if net connectivity is slow in your area then will be a problem compared to my M20 and Lenovo tablet. I don't know why!. Anyway my priority is camera and display hence give 5 rating",4.0 out of 5 stars
415,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2021,Amazon Customer,Good hardware ruined by bloatware,"1) Too much of bloatware. 2) Poor performance and battery backup (probably due to the bloatware). Irony is that all that work gone in to improving the battery capacity and having a high RAM is completely negated by junk apps pre-loaded, most of which can't be deleted directly (I deleted majority of them thru ADB tools). A lot of them can't be deleted as it breaks a lot of general usage like setting up wallpapers, weather widgets, etc. Good piece of hardware entirely ruined by software + self absorbed marketing",2.0 out of 5 stars

419,Reviewed in India on 6 August 2020,Sanjay,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY IT,"Not the best phone on the market. can never come close to their flagship phones. So many features are not there. Its like it's made to feel midrange. The camera is horrible. Just take my word for it. When I bought this phone, I read these reviews, and I was like wow these people probably don't know what they're talking about, but yeah it was a late realisation. And of you're a serious photographer, then forgot about this phone. The camera has no pro mode features. It doesn't have manual focus, or shutter speed . Night mode is so gross you're never going to want to use it. The battery was supposed to be amazing, its not. Its just good. Like a 4500 mah battery. If you're looking for a great UI, then I'll have to get your hopes down again. This is not one UI, it on UI core. Which is basically one UI stripped of all it's cool features. Some great alternatives are : Samsung m31s (if you really want Samsung) realme 6, redmi not 9, Poco x2, and Motorola one fusion.

The shots come out really good n detailed..the only big disappointment is the processor..even with 6gb ram the phone still feels sluggish like a 3gb ram phone...lags time to time..typing slows down..if you are a really fast typer you might notice it..battery charging speed is decent it fits the price range..display is beautiful..another big plus point..vivid mode on the warmer side gives out nice vibrant colours..speaker is average..I'd suggest you put in a few extra bucks n go for the 8gb variant as more ram will help run the apps smoother and may cause less lag.. 4/5* for this!,4.0 out of 5 stars

Its camera quality is a little bit low in low light or medium light but great in daylight. Selfie camera is great better than most of the phones in this budget range. I have seen some lags in this phones.....not much but still. Best thing is that i can move my apps from internal storage to sd card as most phones not allows this thing.

424,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,Kishore Singh,REVIEW AFTER USING 15 DAYS,"Simple and straight:. Pros:. - Battery. - Display clarity, bcz it's Amoled and also the size. - Enough speed according to it's configuration. Mine is of 6gb RAM. - UI, i used Mi before and thought it was the best UI till i started using this. This ONE UI is too good but will let you know about Flaws in ""Cons"". - This one for Amazon, i purchased it with exchange of my MI mobile bcz of the recent revolution, u know. The exchange value was very good, thanks to Amazon.. Cons:. - Fingerprint scanner sometimes is non-responsive, have to use power button to awake screen. - There is no multi tasking windows available in this UI. - Media volume is not loud enough, Bass lovers can't have enough loudness when playing music. - No IR blaster, which is very useful, Samsung should provide atleast in future. - No LED indicator for notification. These are what i observed and mentioned as per my experience, may be useful especially for anyone going purchase or Samsung and for Amazon. Basing on these, you can consider your priority. Cons aren't that big and few can be changed or updated. Finally I recommend for buy. It is a Good Mobile.",4.0 out of 5 stars

430,Reviewed in India on 25 September 2020,Yogesh kumar,Worst of worst it is an abomination,To all the user who are seeking a mid range phone do not absolutely not buy any Samsung phone. For the first time I bought this M31 Samsung product. And within a month the phone stopped working and I had to visit service centre which took 1 and a half month to rectify my issue that too when I lost my patient and decided to move to Consumer Forum. The most drastic experience I ever had.. Now talking about the phone it is simply not worth the dont be fascinated by the add it is not anything like the advertisement.. Battery is not fast charging.. You take 6 GB or 8 GB after a while you will experience slang and hang up.. Camera for name 64 but more equivalent to 12 or 16.. Support worst nor the service centre or customer care will do it in time. All you will be getting is harassment . This is my experiences and I will urge and advice all my friends and family do not buy not only this but any Samsung product .,1.0 out of 5 stars
431,Reviewed in India on 12 July 2020,Susmitha,Made in India and great specs for a reasonable price.,"I got a 8Gb 128Gb variant. The phone is great value for money. I'm sure everyone's read the specs and are looking for more user experience insights, so here goes mine. I wanted to buy a phone which gets latest security patch updates at least for the next 2-3 years (else my office mail doesn't work). I also wanted one that was made in India and owned by an Indian entity. A phone meeting both requirements doesn't exist. So the next best option is a good phone (security patch) made in India by an entity that does not have a Chinese owning entity. Options were Panasonic (Jap) and Samsung (Kor). I've used Samsung phones before so went for this which had the following pros:. 1. Made in India. 2. 6Gb/8GB RAM. 3. 64/128 Gb ROM. 4. Fast processor (handles heavy apps with ease). 5. Smart finger print sensor with notification scroll feature. 6. Awesome battery backup. 7. Nice pics for this price. 8. Amazing display. 9. Great sound quality, enhances the music experience on external speakers too.. 10. Auto disable screen timeout when face detected. There may be many more features I don't use.. but I'm a typical person mostly using for work and some web surfing. I don't play games so don't know.. On cons (explaining why I gave 3 stars) is only one.. the first phone delivered started shutting down on its own after a day. I quickly raised a replacement request and I got a new one and that's working great but the hassle of having to do all that is not nice. I also read that this issue is there a lot. So Samsung needs to take note and fix this.. Otherwise awesome phone guys 15-20k range, this is by far the best phone. And it's made in India!! :) go for it guys!",3.0 out of 5 stars

Overall 4.2/5.. Build quality not good. I mean just nice. If i rate it then 3/5. Actually the back of the device is made with polycarbonate so If it were glass, it would be the best all-rounder device in this budget.. Screen just superb. 4.7/5.. Camera quality also nice. 4/5.. Performance also good. I used Samsung J7 prime for 2 and half years. So i know what is the problem with exynos processor. So there exynos 9611 also good processor for approx 2 years. But then this is behave just a 7k-8k budget device. If there was a Snapdragon 712 or 720G processor, it would definitely be rocking device from SAMSUNG under 20k budget. Okay but the current performance is really smooth and cool. So 4/5.. Fingerprint scanner good but also have face unlock option so no problem for device lock security. Both work fine. 4/5.. Battery gives approx a day with medium usage. 4/5. But charging time really slow. 6000 mAh battery takes time to getting full charge around 2.5 hours. 3/5.. Ok let's talk. I think i covered all the pros and cons. Then you decide that what should you do, buy or not buy. If you ask me then definitely go for it if you watch movie and video with decent gaming.

435,Reviewed in India on 20 January 2021,Amazon Customer,Front camera selfie very poor quality .,It's front camera of 32 mp is very poor than front camera of M21 (less pixel).And if this is manufacturing defect then it must be rectified by samsung .. But unfortunately Samsung service center is saying it's front camera images are perfect and can not be further improved.. Anyone can look above images of M31 and M21 and may compare and will say M31 image is not perfect.. On this experience I will suggest not to buy M31 mobile .It is better to purchase low cost Mobile M21.To buy M31 it is waistage of money 🤑. I am totally unsatisfied with the response of Samsung authorities.They are not solving the problem and raising the dispute.. Very disappointing response from Samsung galaxy company..

As per suggestion I updated phone immediately. The look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.. Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.. However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.. Once this phone restarted on its own.. Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.. Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.. Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.. After 3 months, I experience the hanging once every week.. Gets heat up a lot on video calls of WhatsApp, Zoom and Duo calls and restarts automatically..

441,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Raghav M.,Samsung M31 - A must buy mobile in less than 20K budget,"I am using this phone from 7 days and in the seven days I have reviewed it and below are my observations:. Unlock speed-. Unlock speed using face recognition and fingerprint sensor is really super fast. you will not feel any lag while unlocking the phone it will open it up with just in fraction of a second. Camera -. Having 64 MP camera in a budget of this phone is really unexpected you can click eye catching pictures using front and back camera the back camera has 4 sensors which allows you to click macros, depth , Wide Angle and normal pictures in high definition quality.. the front camera which is 32 MP allows you to click steady pictures with wide angle for group selfies as well. Battery life and charging -. Well, with the battery life I am not that much satisfied as I expected it to be. Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.. Performance -. Over all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.. Overall summary -. In this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on. It's made in India mobile so you can definitely use this mobile without any hassle so go to amazon Amazon Samsung website, buy your mobile, start using it and enjoy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
442,Reviewed in India on 17 March 2020,Anmol Rastogi,Good Budget phone,"Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.. Pros:. 1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.. 2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.. 3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.. 4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.. Cons:. 1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.. 2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.. Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
443,Reviewed in India on 25 May 2020,Dips,Very good phone at this price range currently in market,"Update from my end after 2+ months of use: heat issues has been sorted out after few updates. You can confidently buy this phone at this price range (15-18K).. Call Quality - 10/10, crystal clear voice. Network quality - 10/10. Camera - 6/10 (64mp or 48mp is just numbers now a days, doesn't work like expected). But one thing, Photos in night is really awesome, better than even high end phones I can confidently say.. Previous feedback was:______________. Heating issue. I have requested return. Heating very much near ear speaker/camera area/top area of mobile (even without charge or apps open). I'll keep you posted regarding status after 10 days too.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I am an electronic engineer and i know whats the problem will arise if we have a water log. There is no issue on any of the IC its a pure mother board issue which they need to replace but they are putting back to customer and requesting to pay INR 9K for replacement.. At the start phone was really doing good, i was happy the way it performed apart from heating issues. But the way services are done this is a pure business.

445,Reviewed in India on 2 August 2020,Dipankar,Go for it,"Obverall performance is best. Samsung is Samsung. Even better than socalled redmi series. Its display and dolby atmos sound is awesome. Main is speaking clarity over call which is supab. Battery life goes upto 2 days even after using it as hotspot device for my smart TV for more than 6 hrs. primary 32 mp camera takes gr8 pics. I won't say rear camera is not good. It is also gr8. But u can't use flash in 64 mp setting. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock do its job well. Fast charge takes 2 and half hr to full charge from 10%. But I prefer more slow charger as that will increase battery life. And remember it has non removable battery. So why to worry if it takes 4 hrs to full charge. Overall go for it without thinking for alternate.. But one problem, seller didn't supply ejection pin with the mobile. I don't want to return as mobile is superb. But seller must check such mistakes before delivery. For someone he may forget to send charger or even mobile. I would expect that delar to send the ejection pin seperately as I won't get it from market.",5.0 out of 5 stars
446,Reviewed in India on 24 October 2020,Ahmed ,This. Phone. Is. Everything. 💯,"Best buy for anyone! Price point seems brilliant for all the specs that come with the phone. I have my phone on me 24/7... so I think I can speak for most of the people out there who are looking for a mid priced SMARTphone. Everything has been smooth. Decent display. No lag whatsoever, although, I did have doubts seeing the processor this came with. I still love this phone. Fingerprint reader scans quick and is hassle free. The battery life is amazing. Fully charged, it lasts me a day with heavy use (almost 24hrs). I particularly love how sharply detailed the zoom is on this phone and the macro mode is LOVE. Many more modes which I didn't particularly use but looked good on just my first try like the slow mo and a mode just for food pics! You've got a lot of features that you'd get on expensive phones like the A series and I've only mentioned what I love the most here. Go for the M31 for the Quad cam and the monster battery life. The space black color option looks pretty cool and sleek. Not disappointed.. yet? No regrets🤩",5.0 out of 5 stars

Internet data speed indicator, which is available in almost every other current smartphone, is missing in Samsung.. 2. Screenshot taking is very complicated and not suitable for people acquainted with legacy screenshot mechanisms (three finger scroll/power button+volume down button pressed simultaneaously). 3. Feeble network not detected (in network-deprived areas), which is being detected in other smartphones in the same area.. 4.

449,Reviewed in India on 10 November 2020,Dhairya,Good phone with a few issues,"I used Moto G series phones for six years before buying this m31 model. Transition was not at all smooth. As m31 does not have stock android so there are a few unnecessary additional apps which will keep sending notifications.. The biggest headache was voice quality during calls. Almost all of my calls gave bad voice as if connection was getting broken. I had to opt for factory reset after two weeks. Still it is not a fine quality. I will check this for few more days.. Fingerprint scanner is just slow. Multiple attempts are needed to unlock. Low sensitivity of scanner is issue. More than 5 attempts of scanner lead to locking of scanner for some time. Touch screen sensitivity is also not very high.. Apart from this phone seems very good. All other reviews of good camera, etc are correct.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The Camara quality is as expected and good.. The Battery charging time is very long almost 3 hours for full charge not even quick charge. as said in product details and battery drains quickly even normal usage like browsing and dissatisfied with battery performance. Even my old Vivo U10 with 5000 mach gives great back up.. The sound system is really awesome and much more than expected.. Over all it is just ok phone and as expected in price range of 17k or 18k..

Once i dropped the phone and thought it would have damaged the screen, but nothing happened. Had it been my previous so claimed metallic Chinese phones it would have definitely caused a body dent and screen crack.. Cons:. Charging time is high.. Night light pictures are not good.. For ergonomic use phone would have been a little wider and shorter. This is my personal preference.. Overall a gòod quality product from Samsung.",5.0 out of 5 stars
452,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Ravendra Singh,Great phone...... read whole honest review (after 2 months of purchase),"Fingerprint reader is good unless you have sweat on your fingers..... face lock is very accurate.The battery life is awesome and long lasting. It comes with McAfee antivirus preinstalled as inbuilt part of phone settings. The camera quality is somewhat controversial....... the quality of pictures clicked is very good.... the AI of camera is also nice ... only problem faced by me is it doesn't look like its 64 MP..... my mother has one plus 6 and it has 20 MP which I compared and found has equal zoom..... otherwise the quality of capture is far greater than even my sisters one plus 7. I recommend this phone and in this segment ..... samsung has just got everything boosted. The ram us also good..... I have not played very heavy games on it except once I played a 3.5gb role playing game and it was still working fluid. Front camera is also very good and captures really clear pics. Macro camera is also nice. I charge this phone once and use for almost one and a half day without trouble. It's a bit heavy than recent smartphone but it's because its battery is jumbo but the weight is evenly distributed and once in use..... you will never find it a problem. The Dolby sound AI works really great and is only applicable when using earphones or headset. The inbuilt speaker is also loud and clear. The screen has very diverse, bright and clear display.. Totally recommend it ...... I purchased is within a month of its arrival on Amazon",5.0 out of 5 stars
453,Reviewed in India on 26 October 2020,Amazon Customer,Samsung M31 - good buy at a good price,"I am liking the M31 so far. it has been only a few days and the phone has not given me any reason to complain. the photos seem good and the phone quality is good. the speaker is a little grainy but i am going to watch it.. the one thing to call out is the charging port - it is not a MicroUSB port like any other android phone. this is a customized port and hence you cannot use any microusb charge -which is a big downside and hence the rating of 3. i will update this review in a few weeks after checking out the other features.. another problem is the feature to cast onto the android TV. this is so much pain to cast and it offers some screen sharing feature which never worked for me. Unless the app you are using supports casting to TV, it can be painful to try and cast from this phone. other phones less than half the price of this phone are doing a great job of that. overall is a good phone and i like the overall features, coverage etc within the price offered.",4.0 out of 5 stars

458,Reviewed in India on 17 January 2021,Irfan,I would recommend you to buy Samsung Galaxy M31,"Hey guys, I am using this mobile since last 6 months so now I thought I can conclude about this device.. Battery🔋 ya guys as you know this mobile is having a 6000Mah battery and that will gave you atleast 1 day of backup. And it will take 2 and half hour to charge 100% and adapter comes with an 15W (quite good).. Display This mobile is actually popular for their display. yaa this device is have a *Super Amoled* display. It will provides a more colour as compared to ips lcd displays.if you love to watch a web series or you like to watch videos definitely this mobile makes you happy.. Processor: performance is good(exynos 9611). No heating and lagging. But if you compare with snapdragon 665 it is quite slow.. Back Camera (64MP) is really amazing .. macro camera provides a extremely close range pictures with better quality.. Ultra wide, it will cover as much as your eyes can.. Front camera(32MP) If your vivo or oppo user. Then you feel it was not good,bcz it doesn't support so many filters, But if you ask me what is your opinion, I feel it's better.. Memory. (RAM) i prefer to buy a 6GB ram bcz this mobile processor is not full fast as a snapdragon processor. (ROM) 64 and 128GB its Your choice you can choose according to your storage need and 512 Gb external card supported.. Face unlock is not too good but. Finger print sensor works very fast.",4.0 out of 5 stars
459,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Bhargav Saikia,Amazing cool phone at an amazing affordable price.,"Really great phone at a great price. I have been using since two months..runs smoothly without any lag. The best thing is the display.. Amazing amoled display with true black which dramatically enhances the user experience and the infinite display is a plus.. The camera is quite good. amazing picture quality with a good resolution. Front camera is quite good and convenient for video calls. 64 mp camera, along with wide angled camera are some cool features. But it becomes little bad when you zoom.. like water coloring... image processing can be improved. But is acceptable at this price. Dont expect picture quality like that of an iphone or a 30000 plus phone.. Battery is good enough for me. As i use it only for calls and browsing and normal regular use like watching movies, YouTube...it gives a decent battery support and lasts upto 1 and a half day. Not suitable for gaming purpose. Doesn't feel like 6000 mAh. Might be because of the Amoled display as each pixel actively consumes power. Although, black screen uses no power as compared to LCD, still Amoled consumes more power than an average LCD or LED display. Again, battery performance acceptable at this price when compared to the other cool features at this price.. Fingerprint sensor works smoothly.. And at last, amazing looks and i really like the ocean blue color and the sides are gradually blackened! Stunning looks.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It was bulky with terrible weight distribution.. I returned the note 9 pro max and bought this. It is one of the best decisions I have ever made.. To be fair Redmi 9 pro max has a better processor on board and if did heavy tasks or multi tasking 'regularly' then you may consider it over this.. However it comes with miui 12 which uses up a lot of ram & processor on that phone as a result I got only 3gb usable ram with all apps closed, out of the box. Here I get 3.8 gb out of the box.. Also the samoled display is no joke. I'm able to use my phone outdoors in direct sunlight. I can't imagine going back to ips now..

About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.. The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use..

470,Reviewed in India on 8 September 2020,Harshil Gupta,PHONE IS GOOD but experiencing some serious SCREEN GLITCH,"The box wasnt tampered at all, received in good condition. Initially it worked great and works even now, but later found some pretty signifcant heating issues with the device, especially at the top area of the screen, near front camera. Don't know the reason. Also now since last two months I am experiencing some serious screen glicthes which is irritating me now. If you all want a phone of this range, well then i suggest you to put in 2 - 3 k more and buy M51 now.. CAMERA works good, wide angle photos are also good, but some details are lost at the borders of the image, the image is automatically colour corrected after each click which is okay but sometimes gets a bit too much, stabilisation isn't really what you would actually like to expect, Just fine, for vloggers any stabilizer or monopod is a must. Selfie camera is also great so heyyaa all selfie geeks, have a good time. PROCESSOR is also capable of performing various tasks at same time but I would prefer you to go with SnapDragon processors in the first place.. DISPLAY is something Samsung never fails to meet our expectations. AMOLED screen is truly nice, colours are vivid.. FINGERPRINT sensor in this mid range phone in my opinion is good. No issues with it, good timing and speed.. OVERALL, ok product to be bought at this price but then M51 is better version of it, so i would prefer you to go with it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

If there is lots of complication in running this kind of offer then company should avoid such subscription offers as customer suffers a lot & also comapny lose their trust amongs customers..

Previously i had lenovo k8 whose camera quality was bad than samsun m31 still even though i tilt my mobile still it could unlock the phone an bad light also it could unlock quickly.

477,Reviewed in India on 19 January 2021,Ankit Jetani,Has network issues and many basic feature are missing,"I have been using Mi phone for the past 5 years and my experience is very good with it, but this time I bought this Samsung phone to boycott Chinese products, but I'm not happy at all with the quality provided by Samsung considering the price I paid. Here are the pros and cons.. Pros:. - Longer battery life. - Camera quality. Cons:. 1. Network issue. There is a network reception issue with the phone. Someone can't call us many times. We have to keep the phone in Airplane mode and then only the other person will be able to call. This happens frequently which is extremely annoying. Tried to show it to customer care multiple times but they just check it when we go to them and at that time calling was working as the issue is intermittent so they didn't provide any solution.. 2. It doesn't have many common features in-built like showing the internet speed in the notification bar or app locks which is available in most other brands. We have to install individual apps for each such features which is ridiculous.",1.0 out of 5 stars

479,Reviewed in India on 10 July 2020,NILESH SHARMA,"Read the review, btw for me its a Amazing Straightforward Device👌","Its been like more then 2 weeks since i am usig this phone with my primary sim.. I have been testing all the features and usability this phone offers till this time and now i feel i can give my thoughts about this device.. So lets make pointers:. -Built: I feel the phone has amazing built Quality. Whereas Yes, the Plastic back won't feel much premium but it is actually much more practical then glass back phones. Yes it can scratch easily but who uses a phone without a cover as i would suggest to get a premium cover to get that premium feeling.. Talking about Glass back phones it would be very costly to replace but the plastic shell of m31 would be much more cheaper.. -Display: As you already knew its best under 20k segment. Better then other Amoled screen and No Crazy 120hz refresh rate but yeah it feels much better to use.. -Software: I was using a stock android device previously and the experience of oneui is actually not bad its smooth and even fun to use. There are some hiccups here and there which is acceptable but one thing is that recent app menu lags alot while switching between apps ruining all the experience.. It can be fixed via some software updates.. Hardware: Phone is not heavy. The buttons are placed right, good quality buttons gives premium and positive feedback. Fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate too.. -Camera: The camera quality is actually very good. All the cameras are quite usefull if you know how to use them. The Wide angle and macro camera is also good but implementation is not that great a software update can fix that too.. For the night i can say that the shots are blur and grainy if you can use the camera properly then you can take some amazing shots like i do so for me the night camera is also good not great. Whereas some updates can do improvements to it.. -Battery: Best battery life of any phone i have used till now. Yes the charging speed could have been better but the battery life is soo good that you will hardly rush for a charge.. Note* first charge heats the device bad but after 2-3 days of usage it gets back to normal nothing to worry about. My device doesn't heatup now.. My usage includes all day 2active sims, 50% brightness all day, wifi/data ON 24/7. 2hrs Gaming,1hr youtube, Some calls, and all day social media.. With a usage like this, my phone starting from 100% in the morning to 2nd day evening dropping to 25-30%. I never let my device go below that. Even the stand-by time of the phone is great.. -Performance: Its fast and fluid. Whereas the ram management could be Better which can be fixed. No heating issue. Good for normal to heavy gaming. Overall the performance is Very Good of the device.. This device is not specified for a single use. Its practically a straight forward device which allows the user to use it as a phone should be used. The phone doesn't offer any hanky panky Stuff for attention making anyone mad for games nor for tiktok.. Verdict: If you are a rough user or you travel alot, if you are not a mad gamer then you can go for this device.. It offers best practicality and usability thats how a phone should be.",4.0 out of 5 stars
480,Reviewed in India on 5 February 2021,Mayank tyagi,Good camera but hopeless bluetooth and performance,"I purchased this phone with high hopes.. Camera: the camera is awesome. I saw one issue though, there is no way I can chose Scan option. I have to rely on camera automatically detecting that document being shot and then it gives scan option which fails sometimes. This auto mode dose not work always.. Performance: screen freezes sometimes during normal usage. Also phone crashed once in last 1.5 month. I did not expect this with 6GB RAM.. BLUETOOTH: Not at all Happy, the integration with my Sony car audio system is not seamless. Everytime I take it into car I have to chose the device after switching on phone bluetooth, it does not pair automatically.

482,Reviewed in India on 22 July 2020,Rohan ,Best mobile under 20k,"After 1 month usage, here is my review.. I had been using Moto for years now but got fed up with not up to date build quality and poor performance. I am also not comfortable with UI that is far from stock android, so didnt give the chinese phones a look. So M31 was my best option.. Samsung One UI with Android 10 is an absolute pleasure to navigate.. 6GB RAM is more than enough with 3.5 GB always available without any apps open.. It multi tasks with ease.. Screen is AMOLED Full HD and it completely blew your mind as a first time AMOLED user. The difference between AMOLED and normal screen is astounding. Once you get used to it, you won't be able to go back to normal screen. Best Display on a budget phone hands down.. I was discouraged by other reviews saying Exynos processor is not good. However I have had no problems with it. Ofcourse if you compare its benchmarks with Snapdragon, it falls behind but that does not make it a bad processor. But trust me, looking at it alone, it is good with no problems. I haven't encountered any stutter or lag till now. Even gaming like Call of Duty and PUBG is perfect with medium settings. Ultra high drops some frames but that is expected of a budget phone. And anyway, gaming experience is perfectly fine on medium settings.. Haven't yet tested camera with the lockdown going on but for normal user like me, I found it to be of good quality.. Battery is a behemoth and easily lasts 1.5 days with normal usage. with 1-2 hours gaming, I need to charge it only once every morning.. Because of battery its slightly on the heavy side but you wont notice because weight distribution is excellent. Feels extremely nice to hold. I strongly recommend getting a cover as the back is glossy and picks up a ton of smudges. That's the only con I experienced.. Having used Moto G series and Moto X series in the past, I can safely say this is the best budget smartphone I have brought till date. Phones with specs like this used to cost 30-40k 2 years back. Absolute steal.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Its very feeble and breaks intermittently. I can hear fine though. But since the other person can't hear well, the basic function of a phone is not met.. I clicked ""return item"" a couple of days back and haven't heard anything from anyone. So I am writing this review.. Edit : after a month of usage, I obswrve this: charging takes almost 3 hours. Why do they keep making phones like this? To fool the public? People, do yourself a favour and do not buy this phone. You will be dealing with frustration. Of course, the other problems I stated earlier stands. And did I tell you, no one responded to my return request. I did a return request after 5 days of usage.

485,Reviewed in India on 19 March 2020,𝖘𝖍𝖗𝖊𝖊,Good products but improvements is need we didn't expect without cons with in 20k from samsung,To be frank!! I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery. The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI.

Excellent features, no way behind Apple, great look, back side finger sensor is of great help to easy opening of screen lock. I took some photos , same frames both with my iPhone 11 & Samsung M31.

487,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,radheshyam r.,"No Samsung Pay, Exceptional battery life, light ergonomic phone, rapidly improving camera","Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don't need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about.. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours.. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can't use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense.. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and ""reduce animations"" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time.. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox security. Display: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experience. Sound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that's what Bluetooth speakers are for). Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that's not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can't sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light. Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table",4.0 out of 5 stars

Despite 6000mAh, I did not find it to be great. It was just good.. Coming from an iPhone, I felt android phones' are way behind in Image processing techniques. Realized that pixel MP values are just to lure people and the real power of a camera lies in the Image processing.. Rest everything is normal like every other phone.. If you want to buy a Samsung 4GB RAM phone and macro photography doesn't matter for you, go for the M21.

The packaging was normal, with no extra protection from amazon and got delivered within 48 hrs of order which is very good. Now the points are:. 1. Battery life is not as per expectation. I use it mostly for call (2hrs/day), Whatsapp (almost the entire day), and little bit net surfing like youtube, Google, etc. In that the battery just crosses a day, 100 to 10% time is 28-30hrs.. 2. Touch/ fingerprint sensor is still very fast and smooth till now. The response time is quite satisfactory.. 3. Real AMOLED display works good and image quality is truly amazing. Also the speaker is loud for normal use.. 4. Overall Camera performance is good. Selfie cam, the Back cam is very good but sometimes pictures used to capture hazy a little bit. I'm not quite sure if the picture quality actually provides 64MP standard pics. Grains are there, Sharpness is low if you zoom any pic little bit..

496,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Aditya Sissodiya,Best Made In India Mid Tier Smartphone.,"M31 is one of the best mid tier, made in India, ""budget smartphone"" out there right now for people looking for an upgrade from their entry level smartphones. The super AMOLED display, 6000mAh battery, 128 GB storage and a Samsung Exynos processor, that's a little better from the top of the line 600 series Qualcomm Snapdragon line of processors are the strongest selling points. The UI occupies a lot of RAM, 1.8 GB on an average, and the battery performance isn't mind-blowing, it's great 1&1/2 days of usage easily (playing some games, watching YouTube for 3-5 hours), which you'd expect from a 6000mAh battery (I expected a little more). The camera is great, macro shots are well lit and crisp, 64MP main sensor senses colour pretty well, and the wide angle isn't all that great, but it gets the job done, hyperlapse, slomo features are a great addition. Front facing camera is ""okayish"". The phone feels heafty and sturdy to the touch, and feels responsive overall, transitions to background apps are a bit jittery, but I believe it's a UI issue, and not a performance issue. PUBG runs well, if you plan to play casually. Overall, I've been using this phone for over a month now, and I have no major complain. Totally recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I was super excited while I saw the features like battery, camera, screen size all in my budget. But from past 1 month, I am facing an issue. Sometimes while I use the camera or watching a video and sometimes while I play the game into it, its screen gets completely black. If within 4 months I am facing this issue then I don't expect that it will work even for a year. Completely disappointed with Samsung. I won't go for Samsung in future.",3.0 out of 5 stars
512,Reviewed in India on 30 May 2020,Nidhi raikwar,Samsung M31,"I purchased this phone for my dad. But i used it for 4-5 days. And on that basis i can say that:. • The performance of the phone is very smooth. I don't find any hanging problem.. • The battery life of this phone is amazing. If you are using your phone without internet then the battery life works for 3-5 days.. • The camera quality of the rear is nice but front cam is not up to that point. It's like you are using front cam with an beauty editor.. • As you all know about the screen, it's just awesome.. • And other functions of the phone starts properly.. Before purchasing this phone. I compared it to many of the smartphones. And trust me this tops at first in this range. So, if your budget is around 15000 u can go for it without any doubt.",5.0 out of 5 stars
513,Reviewed in India on 27 May 2020,Abhijit B.,True monster,"Purchsed one on launch. Had almost made up my mind to buy M30s but saw notification of this M31 being launched so kept my purchase on hold. The features were good at the price. The wait was worthy. Now using almost since 3 months.. Truely monster battery. With my use easily lasts bit more than 2 days. Fast charging supported. 50% charged within about 40 min with the provided 9V charger. This is sufficient for a day if one is in hurry to leave for work. By the time one gets ready the phone can be charged 50% almost.. Full charge takes about 2.30 hrs. Samsung should have provided a 15 V charger in box as they provide to all the YouTube reviewers. All reviewers spoke of inbox 15W charger.. I would have given 5 star rating in all categories then.. The finger print scanner occasionally fails to unlock with finger print. Have to press the lock button and unlock again with the finger then. Don't know the reason why this happens.. Though I am not a selfie lover or one who keeps on clicking photos often, I found the camera quality good enough, both front and back.. Sound quality is ok. Though feel the speaker could have been bit louder.. No doubts about Samsung amoled display, it's the best. Samsung being pioneer in this. Very bright even with low settings.. Signal reception has no problem.. Expandable memory is a good feature we usually do not see now in flagship phones also.. Overall good product at this price. Go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

517,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,Shreyansh,Best everyday phone,"I'm using my Samsung Galaxy M31 for more than a month and now reviewing it.. Below are the details that I feel and have have experienced during my usage.. - sAmoled display: The best display one can get in the price range. It truely give flagship phone like experience in mid price range phone.. - Bettery: Single charge works for me for more than 1.5 day almost with 3-4 hours daily calls, 2-3 hours daily live streaming, 24 hours net connected. It gets 15W fast charge which takes almost 3 hours to charge this power house from less than 10% to full charge.. - Camera: quad camera setup does it job well. 64MP Primary camera takes decent photos in day light. Live focus also works great. Macro is fine too. Ultra wide mode is also good. Though it has night mode but shows noise. 32 MP front camera is best in this segment.. Processor: Exynox 9611 works absolutely fine for day to day life. I'm not a gamer so not sure about gaming performance. Apps open without any issue and don't feel any lag.. UI: One UI also gives the best experience. It is very smooth and easy to use.. The other good thing about this phone is that Samsung is providing McAfee security in this phone which no one will find in Chinese phones.. So if you have the budget of 17-18k for new smart phone and want to get smooth and best experience in this price range, please go ahead and buy this phone. But if you less budget around 14k the go for Galaxy M21 in which one will get tri camera setup instead of quad in M31 and have 64GB internal memory which should also be sufficient and rest of the features list are same as M31.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have purchased ovwr 6 samsung devices through Amazon. Unfortunately my phone broke and i purchased a new one rather than getting it fixed just because of my trust in the brand and its quality. I purchased this Samsung M31 on __17th_sept_ its been just __23_ days and believe me i take care of my things like they are very precious. Always have. Today i had left my phone to charge and a few minutes later when i checked, the screen appeared to have a crack across the screen. As if it expamded from the inside and broke. The whole reason i purchased this phone was because the old phones screen broke. I could have simply got it fixed but i didnt.

Charging Time- It takes roughly 120-150 Minute to charge it to 100%, considering battery of 6000MAH a fast charger is must.

526,Reviewed in India on 16 March 2020,Chayan B.,Things to consider before purchasing M31,"So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:. 1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.. 2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.. 3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.. 4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.. 5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.. 6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.. 7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.. 8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.. 9. Headphone is not given with phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.. 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.. Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is just average..

535,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Ganesh Hegde,Just go for it; satisfied,Believe me guys this is the best overall package u can get under 18k i have just brought a 64gb variant from amazon at 16k and trust me guys it exceeded my expectations. Firstly lets talk about the cons or negative points of the phone. 1. The polycarbonate back is a fingerprint magnet and is quite slippery applying a cover is Highly reccomended. 2. The glass on the front is highly fragile and gets easily cracked. So applying a tampered glass is necessary.. 3. The front camera performs very poor in low light. 4. The fast charging is enabled by default but the battery backup is around 9hrs but if i disable fast charging i could get around 12 hrs of screen on time again that is a good thing because u can just charge it at night as it takes around 4 and half hours to charge completely. Now lets talk about pros:. 1. Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.. 2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devices. In the competition. 3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.. If u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition,5.0 out of 5 stars

In pubg graphics setting goes till hdr but it is of no use ,the exynox processor will struggle to pull it off. In hd settings is playable but after 15min it will lower the graphics settings. Camera is of average, in bright day light it performs well but its way poor compare to other rivalry in this price range. Over all its an all-rounder mobile dont except anything,. Its display is awesome you will enjoy the display fo movies and vedio playback. So people with less usage of gaming and camera can buy this undoubtedly best.

I did not have option to return, only replacement was available. It took additional 9 days for the replacement to reach me that too after multiple conversations and ""so called"" inspection and all. After all this when I got the phone which was fortunately in working condition, I'm not at all happy with the output. 1- finger recognition is not very good, you have to tap hard.. 2- Face direction doesn't work on multiple accounts.. 3- phone takes forever for charging. How can they not provide fast charging in the phone of today's generation?. 4- phone is extremely slippery. Impossible to use without cover.. 5- speaker volume is pathetic.. 6- camera quality is okay okay.. 7- picture quality is pretty good.. I will not at all recommend this phone. I'm sure samsung was able to sell huge number of handsets but they are only trying to ride on anti-china notion going on currently. Since there are very less option if you do not want to buy Chinese phone, many would buy m31.

544,Reviewed in India on 9 October 2020,Mawejje N.,Fake phone at such a price. Not worth every penny.,"Hello friends please don't buy this phone. Don't buy Samsung phones they are too expensive for their value. I have been using this phone for three weeks and the earphone jack and the sound system is done. I handled it with care and I have never dropped it. But sound comes in high frequency , even when I plug in the earphones I hear nothing. It almost cost 18000. I was using Huawei honor 9n for 2 years my old phone never failed me. I thought this phone could be better but it is a waste of money. The only thing that it is better than my old phone is the screen and memory. It has stupid software. No inbuilt screen recorder, the camera is fake and it is too slow. Amazon gave only 7 days replacement I even regret buying it from amazon since flipkart gives a longer return period. I will never buy Samsung items again and I will never use amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.. Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.. Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .. Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.. Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.. No notification LED..

Pros:. 1. Camera is best. 2. Lightweight even after having 6000mAH battery. 3. Fingerprint sensor is very quick. 4. Display has wide color range and quite bright. 5. No software lag. 6. Best for multitasking. 7. Blue light filter is really helpful. 8. The motion stability is pretty useful. It is quite fascination to see that it never feels like the video has ever been shot with the phone holdin in the hands.. 9. The camera captures images with natural colors, not with punchy color like some other phones do.. Cons:. 1. In Macro mode it is hard to focus on object, but it is rarely used. 2.

555,Reviewed in India on 17 July 2020,Ujwal Narayan,Bang for the buck. Go for it!,"I'm reviewing this phone after using it for nearly two months. I bought this phone as a temporary replacement to my flagship. I'm actually very impressed by the price to perfomance ratio of this device. The biggest USP of this phone is its OS. Samsung's OneUI 2.0 has improved tremendously in reducing bloatware and managing RAM efficiently. It multitasks with ease. The battery life is fantastic. I'm putting my device to charge every alternate day, the screen on time is at least 9-11 hours depending on the intensity of the usage. The Camera quality is great, not outstanding. The speaker is loud and clear. It has Dolby Atmos audio drivers for external audio devices. The call clarity is excellent from both ends. The rear camera does a great job but the front camera doesn't live up to the expectations. It smoothens the images taken from the front cam, not sure if it's because of the sensor or if its in the software. Since it's a budget phone I don't think it would be fair to expect a lot. I'm not much of a mobile gamer so I never actually tested it in that aspect. The overall build quality is good, looks premium but the entire body is made of plastic. It nearly takes 150 mins to charge to a 100% with the 15W factory charger. The speed doesn't change even if you use a charger of higher capacity. Coming to the conclusion, I feel this is the best budget phone considering the price and brand value of Samsung. It does its job perfectly and I'll definitely recommend this phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

If you are person who often drop your phone, consider putting a backcover.. 2) Display is amazing beacause its an sAMOLED. But if you break it, it costs too much to replace and cosider a full cover.. 3) Cameras are not as expected. The main camera doesnt feels like 64MP. macro,depth, wide angle are good.. 4) As its an mid range smartphone. HIgh end games can be played but in medium graphics mode. Do not expect a amazing gaming performance for this price range.. 5) Audio is good. Even its a single speaker, the audio is clear ass crystal. Dolby mode works wonderful along with bass head headphones.. 6) Battery is the biggest plus. Used it normally and lasts more than 2days. Used it heavily lasts 24 hours. Some claim that it can be used upto 8hrs continously with gaming and streaming.. 7) Charger is a 15W. Takes roughly 50 minitues to charge from 50-100.. Using it with a backcover.

584,Reviewed in India on 18 September 2020,neelender Thapak,Cheating by Samsung/seller/amazon,"I bought mobile from amazon for my wife. She was was using it last one month. I was busy with my work and for some days out of station. Today my wife told that mobile is hanging frequently. I visited samsung service centre and they told that this is problem due to water. When i told that it never fell in water nor any water drops on it. They told this may be due to. sweat or moisturiser. They are not accepting warranty period. My question is if no water, how this happened. If any water, why no single font of paper label attached inside and outside, affected. No changes in paper quality and even in font style, colour,etc. If really wet why is charging properly. Why no affect in charger, charging point, earphone connecting port and no symptoms in charging port outside. How water/sweat/moisturizer came inside without affecting anything. I think either samusung used defective parts in my mobile or seller replaced it. If not seller fault, why samsung is designing such design for mobile where sweat or moistrizer may come inside and they dont write in warning/notice section. Is their design such worst and keeping space in mobile so that water may come inside without affecting other things. If really this problem, this is also manufacturing defect. I file complaint with customer care but no positive response. I am thinking to file complaint in consumer forum making party Samsung India, Amazon, Seller and their service centre. Please dont buy this phone with this seller until surity with Samsung, seller or Amazon for further service. God know who's fault but 18000 rs loss for me. I am using samsung for many years but i faced such type of problem twice. Now i decided if they will not repair my phone, i will not buy any samsung product in my whole life....",1.0 out of 5 stars

Monster Camera : 64 MP primary camera with 3 more (8+5+5 )on the back capture stunning moments. 4K video quality is also great. I am really satisfied with the back camera system. 32 MP Front camera performance is not upto the mark specially in low light.. Monster Performance : With 6GB RAM and Samsung Exynos 9 octa 9611 processor It runs Samsung OneUI 2.0 on top of Android 10. Satisfied with the performance.. Monster Display : The Samsung Galaxy M31 sports a big 6.4-inch display and has a waterdrop notch at the top. It has thin bezels around the AMOLED display which helps it stand out among the competition.. The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g..

Great job from Amazon.. Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel. The battery was a beast and gives pretty good enough time to use the phone for long time. Camera was nice and overall phone performance was awesome.

Same with selfie camera. Pics in low light/night could be better but guess its a software thing that samsung would fix in the future updates.. Would have loved a metal body and on screen fingerprint sensor but yes can't expect everything at this price. Fullyloaded mobile at this price and best thing is its made in India.,5.0 out of 5 stars

592,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Satya Venkata Sandeep,Truly a Megagalaxy of Samsung universe.,"Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Multiple functions to give photo different effects. Good Battery 6,000mAh battery and 15W Fast Charging timing. Interesting thing mobile not get held even we store multiple apps.

This is Excellent Feature With Fast Face Unlock and a Finger Print Sensor Now unlock your phone instantly with your face or fingerprint.. Good storage capacity.

597,Reviewed in India on 10 March 2020,Anshul Kumar,BEST BUDGET PHONE TILL NOW,"Pros--. 1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY. Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.). 2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT. CAMERA. Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.. Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.. 3. 6000mah BATTERY. Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.. 4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM. Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.. Cons--. 1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR. Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.. 2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX. SECURITY. A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.. 3. BUILD QUALITY. Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.. 4. 15 WATT CHARGER. It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.. Note-. 1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.. 2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.",4.0 out of 5 stars
598,Reviewed in India on 9 November 2020,girish,Average phone over rated and hyped,Bought it for 15k and preferred samsung to avoid direct contribution to chinese manufacturers.. Major plus are rear camera and SAMOLED (though screen didnt perform as expected in outdoor).. Major cons:. Battery doesn't last long as mentioned.. I was previously using a phone with 3050MAH and this doesn't feel any different.. Front camera doesnt even have resolution of 16MP offered Xiaomi.. And phone already lags a bit inside a month of usage thanks to the exynos processor.. Its an average phone which should be available at 10k (it will soon be available at this price in some months owing to its disadvantages)..

You expect 64MP AI camera to match the standards but it performs really poor, even worse than my Samsung galaxy A70(2018) with 32MP camera. They should look more closely in building cameras.

Camera performance is Great in good lighting conditions with all 4 back cameras and 1 Front camera, In low light conditions camera struggles a bit, Battery Backup is 2 Days on Moderate Usage (like: Surfing internet and Social Media), But if you want to play High End Games like PUBG, COD, Even on Medium to High Graphics and Frame Rater then you will be disappointed. So in the end if you are a teenager who likes to click some awesome shots on their phone then this phone is for you OR If you are a Gamer and want more Hardware Performance for playing High-end Games Like PUBG, COD and Fortnight then please look for other options in the market because Snapdragon and Mediatek G90t is best for gaming, Exynos is a good processor not it's not for gaming.

When I use for scenery photos are good too. Only problem I found is sharpness of photo at highest zoom ( zooming photo to its highest) I think sharpness is good but not best.

612,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2020,Ashish,Competitive Mega Monster,"A complete mega Monster. This phone brings back Samsung in competition with the Chinese brands which has captured the market share in recent years.. Before writing this review, let me tell you'll a short brief on my requirements and background. I'm middleaged, working professional from Mumbai and my requirements were basic usage with some multimedia at the EOD. And I'm not a gamer. This is my 3rd mobile in 4 years and prior to this, I've been using A popular known brand and model, Redmi Note 4 since 2017 and another from upcoming company Realme with it's launch model Realme1 since Jun 2018. And my very first Android phone was none other than Samsung Galaxy M (CDMA model) So my experience and expectations were coming from the usage of these 2 recent handsets.. I wanted a mobile which gives me a smooth touch experience (lagging in Realme 1) with a decent performance with best battery (lagging in RN4) and a large storage within a budget of 15k.. This mobile may not be the best for full time gamers however it can definitely help you get a good 2 days battery life (with all day usage with bluetooth connected) with a smooth and vibrant looking display with its super amoled screen and knocking performance for all day to day needs including some gaming. And I'm completely satisfied with Samsung Galaxy M31 for this. With its new OneUI 2.0, I'm completely amazed with the kind of adaptations Samsung has done from its earlier Galaxy series.. I use to always feel, Samsung is am expensive brand and it always offer less against what we pay, however, must say, Samsung changed my perception towards Samsung mobiles. If your planning to upgrade for a smooth all around performance with a huge battery and a sexy display with a budget around 15-16k, go for it and you will love owing it...",4.0 out of 5 stars

618,Reviewed in India on 10 June 2021,Santosh Reddy,Worst phone to have. Display issues.,"I purchased the phone in Jan 2021. After just few months of use, there was pink color spot on my phone. Day by day it started spreading to the whole screen. While my phone is still under warranty, Customer care says the damage to the screen was due to my fault and the screen replacement cannot be covered under warranty.. It seems that even slight pressure on the display will cause damage. This means, you cannot carry the phone in thight pockets which is ridiculous.. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product",1.0 out of 5 stars

621,Reviewed in India on 23 October 2020,George,Good product. But have some problems.,Camera is very nice. Battery life is good.. Super Amoled display.. Processor:. Installation of apps take long time when compared to my realme 2 pro. You definitely feel phone is slow if you have used a phone with Snapdragon processor.. Battery:. Battery life is good. But very slow charging. It take 2.5h to complete charge. It has 6000mAh battery. So it would be good if it has better fast charging.. Performance:. It can handle multitasking and gaming but app loading will be slow.. Conclusion:. If you are old and normal user you like the performance. But you are young and want a faster phone then don't buy this product.,3.0 out of 5 stars

The camera quality is like awesome. He never used to click these many pictures before. It has special food button which is specialized to click pictures of food items. The night camera can make night look like day, ITS THAT GOOD.. 3. AR EMOTICON : Now this is something I like more. It can turn you into emoticons which is like very cool.. 4.

But still few words to say.. 6000 ma battery should last two days unless UI consume huge power. The battery is excess for one day but not monstrous as described.. Fast charger is enough fast only it to charge it three long hours.. The camera quality is good in day light but could not understand why is it told 48 mega pixel. It's a gimmick. A good 13 mp is equivalent to the said 48 mega pixel. The camera fails to impress in low light photography just like other mobile phone camera.. As a whole it's a good buy in the price tag of around Rs.13000.,4.0 out of 5 stars

As claimed the strongest part of this phone is Mega Battery and it's TRUE in every term. With moderate use throughout the day Battery was down to 80% only from full charged in morning. I watched movies for another 2 hours continuously reducing only 10% further to 70%. charging 1 hr was sufficient to get back to 100%. Totally Impressive!!. 2. Camera is phenomenal. Wide angle, super slomo video, hyperlapse, clicks with auto adjustment, night mode, zoom.. all are best in every term. I have attached few clicks & videos. Check out. 3. Very user friendly functions. Everything seems so simple. That's best part too.. 4. I used Samsung smart switch app to transfer my entire data from my old android phone to this one. Without any hiccups totally got that done in one go everything including messages, call records. Everything in matter of hour. Seamless experience.. 4. You can create your own emoji.

Camera quality is great and zoomed photos are very clear too. The display of the phone helps the camera to display it's clicked photos even better. Although i found a big issue that camera isn't able to focus at small objects placed near to it. It maybe a software problem which i am hoping would be resplved with the next update.. Interface:.

The basic camera has excellent low light capability and gives a bright image (is it the screen or the camera?).. in short the camera(s) perform much better than expected.. And the phone feels solid.. The battery again is just great. What's the point having lots of features and not being able to use them? The battery makes them available and reliable.

650,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2020,abdulhakim,Worth every single penny!,"There's hardly anything that i dont like about this smartphone. Brilliant performance, brilliant battery life, amazing camera, brilliant overall.. 1. The screen.. sAMOLED display is on point, super clear & very well user friendly.. 2. The camera.. Stunning. 64mp does the job the way it's supposed to. Front 32mp camrea is also very impressive. In the rear, quad camera setup is impressive. The sample images are a few example of the camera quality. Also the wide angle lens is a rather wonderful function.. 3. The battery.. Probably the biggest highlight of this smartphone is the battery. A MASSIVE 6000mAh battery can easily go on throughout the day with enough battery life left for the next day. For an average user, the battery will easily live upto 2 days. Heavy usage? It will still go on for a day. Even when the battery is about 15 to 20% the performance doesnt show any decline. The only thing i found a bit not so good about the phone is the charger. M31 comes with a 15W charger which will take atleastaround 2.3 hrs to charge fully. But the new M31s fixes the problem, it comes with a 25W charger & the same 6000mAh battery promising shorter charging time.. 4. Built quality & design.. Front and rear looks impressive. Has a very modern yet conservative designs. Doesn't feel that heavy while holding and is also a perfect fit in the pocket.. The blue colour looks beautiful but the one i have is a black one. Yes, the black looks cooler but since the rear is made up of plastic with a glossy finish, it can very easily attaract scratches and fingerprints, so I'd suggestanyone to use it with a mobile cover.. 5. Verdict.. Overall the smartphone is an impressive package. It simply proves that spending over 50k on a smartphone is insane. Some complain about the processor that is Exynos 9611 which is in my point of view nothing to be worried about. Every function runs smooth and easy thanks to the processor and 6gb RAM, touchscreen is also very responsive, also the power button can be used to open apps as a shortcut. With 128gb space, dual sim support, 6gb ram, a great battery life, sAmoled display, this phone has everything that it takes to be a flagship phone competitor as a considerable margin. Its almost been more than 2 months since im using this phone and so far i haven't faced any problems with the device any hopefully will not face any in the coming future. The surprising thing is that with all the power packed in the box, it still manages to fit under 20k category which makes it incredibly appealing. I'd surely suggest if anyone is looking to buy one!",5.0 out of 5 stars
651,Reviewed in India on 16 March 2020,Dhanaraj Naik,An excellent purchase for the price offered,"Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smooth. Battery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expect. Screen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.. Design: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decent. Camera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp cam. Processor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.. OS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.. Brownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.. The phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.. Overall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme.

Limited bloatware, Samsung apps, which can be disabled at least which is good.. Back panel absorbs fingerprints easily. Needs frequent cleaning.. Doesn't come with an earphone. You can buy one outside per your choice.. Suggestions:. Buy a back case and tempered glass for extra safety, though it has gorilla glass.. 6+128 is priced 1k extra. I think 6+64 is quite enough and you can buy another 64gb memory card within 650-700 rs, so saving a little and increasing more data mobility.. Never look at M30 or M30s.

Good:. - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!. - Display is excellent with Blue light filter.. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG. - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE. - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good. Cons:. - Not that thin, but ok.. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex. - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.. - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :). - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.. Feedback. - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.. Go for it without any doub",5.0 out of 5 stars

Pros. 1)Good day light photos. 2)Long battery backup. 3)AMOLED Display. 4)Samsung UI.

Early i used ,lenovo, honor,real me, redmi,Motorola, now i share my experience on that .. Pros good 🔋 life. Good amoled disply. Samsung ui core 2.1 on Android 1o. Good camera quality as it has samsung's own 64mp sensors but not as good as sony imx sensors.. Pros It is budget m31 📱 so plastic body Earlier mia1 has a metal body.. I prefer pure Android ui. Good to purchsed mia1or Motorola or nokia or pixel ui. Processor is not good enough for gaming 9611is used in dozens of samsung phone between 23kto 12k all samsung phone. I used all 📱 having all types of Processor but i prefer snapdragons Processor. Also snapdragons Processor gives good quality sound output compared to other Processor.. Previously i used mia1 has very good sound output samsung m31 could not give that quality sound out put i tested on bluetooth headphone also wires headphone so who hasi to listen 🎶 lot of songs please avoid it. It is 📷 centric phone. So phone is bit long it has big on bottom side so not very handy .one plus nord is very handy phone. So if u want ambled display 🔋 📱 then u should buy it.other wise go to real me phone having amoled display and snapdragons Processor.

659,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Shaurya Sood,Good but not great,The overall Phone design and handling is okay but lacks quality both in the the material used and the software performance. I've been using this phone for over 2 months now and all I can say is that I shouldn't have taken the negative reviews lightly. The phone lags even with minimal activity. The fingerprint sensor is almost insensitive and reminds me of old samsung phone touch screens. The camera quality is amazing but only after you adjust the settings to different(highest) resolution. Battery life is subpar and way lower than what I thought a battery this size would perform but the fast charger takes care of that problem to some extent . The inbuilt operating system lacks any applock which has to be installed from play store. The phone is okay for someone who doesn't use or expect much from his/her phone except basic functionality but I'd recommend going for a different phone if you're a heavy user or for gaming.,3.0 out of 5 stars
660,Reviewed in India on 24 March 2021,Rasmi Lama,Waste of money,I am a Samsung follower but what can I say when you start finding defects on it.... There was a time I used to praise in behalf of samsung and I myself never carried other than samsung in my life from keypad to TouchPad it has been always samsung but M31 is really a disappointment.. Be it camera to sound quality to touch everything's a mess.. I tried to contact customer care of Amazon but I couldn't get in touch because at the time when I got this phone there was a worldwide pandemic crisis and I had to move on with this.... When I make a call it becomes harder for other party to hear my voice and so does with me.... The camera is not as expected as it should be with 64megapixels phones starts lagging very much even after several boot ups and data clearance and scanning devices.. No doubt battery's life is good till date but from the beginning this has been issues I have been dealing with... so I wouldn't never recommend this to anyone because our main perspective to get a phone is to call and when second party can't hear your voice and you have to speak louder to make them hear does that sounds fairer ? NO what if you are in a public place or in a library or in middle of somewhere where you have to recieve the call and speak in lower voice???,2.0 out of 5 stars
661,Reviewed in India on 25 November 2020,ZACHEUS A VANJA,No better than AMAETUER mobiles.,"Camera does not have a focus lock feature, no way to disable Auto Focus feature, worst thing about Typing is it does not automatically save vernacular words you often use, but totally spoils the message u intend to send if you do not check each word you type is what u wana send, Always disconnects from WIFI and need to go through a series of clicks to reconnect WiFi. Bluetooth disconnects and cannot reconnect automatically. Always Apps are forced to reconnect. Camera does not have a Mirror feature for Video recording. A REDMI Note 8 pro is far better than Samsung M31 camerawise features. Only a brand name to pay more for less features. So awful is Samsung with its good for nothing Brand name and the features it gives for the price it mints. I`m thinking of throwing this phone in SHIT. Unwanted notifications and u`re forced to bear whatever Samsung wishes to throw at its customers and does not allow you to uninstall or deactivate such notifications. Has a pet dog name PAYTM which always forces users to read its annoying advertisement promotions. Samsung seems to stoop down to its max level to jeopardize customers with its alluring advertisements and mint money. So bad of myself to write a review like this in my whole life.

667,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Jayesh badgujar,M31 is best mobile,"The Galaxy M31 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M30s, Galaxy A50s, and Galaxy A51. It’s the processor choice for Samsung’s budget and lower mid-range phones, and all I can say is that it gets the job done in day-to-day use.. The Galaxy M30s had the new Exynos 9611 processor under the hood, a 48MP triple camera setup at the back, and a beautiful 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel up front. In fact, Samsung told us at the Galaxy M31 launch that the camera, battery life, and display are the most important factors for young people nowadays, and those are the parameters it focused on when designing the Galaxy M31.. The Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that’s pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there’s a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn’t feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone’s liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.. At the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ’64 megapixels’ mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There’s also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phones. The ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s’ ultra-wide camera. It’s useful to capture a wider scene, but don’t expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it’s great if you love taking close-up shots, though it’s often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.. Here are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots",5.0 out of 5 stars

Next problem is its too slow, it doesnt matter if it has 8 GB ram and 4.5 GB shows as free, if you just try to scroll a whatsapp chat window, or simply type a text message, first word starts to appear on the screen after you have typed entire sentence. A usual ""suggestion"" given by ppl is free up RAM and storage or disable ""auto-restart"" in device care (which is not even enabled). My phone is almost new and i dont play games or do heavy multi tasking. Ram is never 50% utilized and storage is hardly 30 GB used out of 128 GB and yet you cannot even type a text message nicely..

In fact its sim card tray is so fragile that I am really afraid to push it even with moderate force.. Cannot say much about the product quality as I am yet to experience it.,1.0 out of 5 stars

704,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,Shujath,Battery and Design,"After using Samsung Note 3 for a good time, I shifted to M31. The huge battery has been a big relief for me and from the battery drain tension when going on a long trip. I don't use it for gaming so typically I have to charge twice in three days. You may need to keep for a long time for it to charge fully. The screen display is sharp and clear.. The build is good. It fell a couple of times from bed but the curved edges on the sides have prevented it from getting scratches. I don't like putting case or screen protector as it increases the weight and reduces the aesthetics. Also, don't put keys in the same pocket as it can give permanent marks on the glass. The black backside is a finger magnet and it will take some time for you to get used to it..

What you need to know is it's UI is great but on the cost of processor and finger print. It's been almost 2 months and it has started to hang and sometimes to the extent where I have to restart the phone. And talking about finger print scanner it's worthless man because it most of the time doesn't detect it (if you have sweating finger even a bit of it) or delayed detection.

717,Reviewed in India on 26 November 2020,Topil Pandeth,"Despite tough competition, the Samsung Galaxy M31  would certainly stand out from the crowd.x","Samsung Galaxy M31 Review. Over the years, Samsung has figured out the likes and dislikes of consumers, specifically in a mid-range smartphone that’s not only accessible but also offers features that solve almost all main issues, such as long battery life, bright display and the affordable price tag.. Style & Design. The style and design of Samsung M31 is much similar to Galaxy M30. The phone’s back is made of a hard-coated polycarbonate shell. The Galaxy M31 gives a good feel that it is well built and sturdy.. The M31 screen size is 8.9mm and weighs about 191gms. It comes with a couple of colours, such as Marine Blue and Marine black. The one that I bought was Black, which is very good.. You’ll find the power button on the right side with a volume rocker above. Meanwhile, the left-hand side has a hybrid SIM tray. The bottom of the phone has a USB-C port, flanked by a 3.5mm headphone jack and a speaker grill.. Flip over the phone, and you will notice an oval-shaped fingerprint scanner. It’s quick and works great.. Display. The display size on the Galaxy M31 is 6.4-inch Full HD Plus Super Infinity-U display. Even though M30 uses the same screen technology, somehow the display on the M31 screen appears to be slightly superior.. Battery. Despite a strong footing in the display and performance departments, the battery of the Galaxy M31s is easily the best feature of the handset. It comes backed by a 6000mAh battery, which needless to say is huge for a smartphone in this budget.. Despite heavy usage, we were able to get almost 2 days of juice from the device. The handset offers support for 25W fast charging and even comes bundled with a 25W charger that obviously comes in handy to charge the enormous battery on the Galaxy M31s. With normal usage, the power would last for 2 days, and you can certainly avoid carrying a Power bank. One additional feature on the handset is reverse charging making the smartphone act as a power bank in need.. Camera. This time the new M31 is built with special emphasis on Camera. The phone has four rear-facing and non-protruding cameras housed in a large square shaped camera module in the left-hand corner. This new quad camera cluster housing 64MP main, 5MP macro, 5mp depth and 8MP ultra-wide, along with LED flash is fabulous, and the results are astonishing.. One of the main talking points of the Samsung Galaxy M31s is its cameras. The handset offers four cameras on the back. The primary camera is a 64-megapixel sensor and an f/1.8 aperture. This camera by default captures images in 16-megapixel resolution and if you do want to click an image in the 64MP resolution you have to manually select the 64-megapixel mode from the aspect ratio option.. Next, there is a 12-megapixel ultra wide-angle camera with 123-degree field of view and an f/2.2 aperture. You will also get a 5-megapixel macro and depth sensor each offering f/2.4 aperture.. The camera of the Galaxy M31s boasts of a ‘Single Take’ feature. This is basically one click option to capture a small video that the handset automatically turns into 6 multiple shots. These shots are ’best moments’ that basically is the ideal image as per Samsung’s AI from the clip, then you get a version with filters with this shot and also a cropped version so that the object is in the center. Other than that, you also get the original video, a hyper lapse one and a boomerang version of the same. We certainly enjoyed using this particular feature as you get all the possible options and a choice to select what you like the best.. The primary camera of the handset is able to capture images that are rich in colour and sharp. The ultra-wide angle camera is also good enough for you to click shots that do not lose on the essential details of the image. You get a simple toggle on the home screen to switch between the primary sensor and the ultra wide angle sensor. Macro shots are also quite detailed thanks to the dedicated sensor and the Live Focus mode for portraits is also going to cover your needs to get accurate bokeh effect. Images in low-light were also quite good as the distortion was minimal.. On the front, you get a 32-megapixel sensor that by default clicks images in 8-megapixel resolution by default and in 12-megapixel for the wide-angle ones. Same as was in the case of the rear cameras, you can select the 32-megapixel resolution from the aspect ratio option.. Performace. Samsung Galaxy M31s performance is powered by the company’s own Exynos 9611 processor. This processor is based on a 10nm FinFET technology and offers two quad-core clusters of Cortex-A73 clocked at 2.3GHz and Cortex-A53 clocked at 1.7GHz. Buyers get two options when it comes to storage. The base variant offers 6GB RAM and the second variant packs 8GB RAM. Both variants offer 128GB internal storage. There is even support for a microSD card in the Samsung Galaxy M31s up to 512GB so there is no issue of storage.. At 8.9mm thickness and weighing 190 grams, the Galaxy M31 is exactly the same size as the Galaxy M30s. Given the phone packs a 6000mAh battery, I think it’s not as heavy as you would expect. Honestly, it doesn’t feel too big and I could use the phone one-handed.. The company has moved the position of the fingerprint sensor to the power button, which takes a couple of days to get used to, especially if you have been using the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. This power button is placed on the right edge of the handset, right below the volume rockers. While the SIM card tray is placed on the left, the bottom edge of the smartphone comes with a speaker grille, along with a USB Type-C and a 3.5mm. The Samsung Galaxy M31s offers an upgraded design as it houses an Infinity-O display, a.k.a punch-hole design for the selfie camera. The bezels of the screen are super thin on the sides, which is quite expected, however they are surprisingly thin at the bottom as well. Samsung claims that the screen to body ratio is over 91% and the aspect ratio is 20:9, which in lay man’s terms means more viewing experience. In terms of the display specification, Samsung has offered a full-HD+ resolution (1080 x 2400 pixels) Super AMOLED display of 6.5-inch in size.. You get rich and vibrant colours and even at tricky angles you do not see major loss of quality. Even under direct sunlight, you won’t find yourself struggling with the legibility on the screen.. The Galaxy M31s offers support for Dark Mode, a feature that is quite popular among the masses and you also get the option to choose the screen modes from Vivid and Natural. It also lets you turn on the Blue light filter and night mode. You can also select the font size and style, level of zoom for the text appearing on the screen as part of display customisations.. The company chose to go for a slightly older processor, however, the Galaxy M31 handled all tasks without any issues, despite prolonged screen hours. The smart phone did not encounter any issues with multiple app usage, long hours of online streaming, game play, etc. There were also no issues related to network reception. In terms of audio also, both the speaker output as well as the 3.5mm jack output were loud enough. There were no complaints in the security department too as both the facial unlock and fingerprint sensor are fast and quite responsive.. In terms of software, the Samsung Galaxy M31s runs One UI 2.1 based on Android 10 operating system.. Being a custom UI, the Galaxy M31 comes with additional features such as theme support, Dual Messenger that lets you run two versions of supported apps, Device care that optimises the handset in terms of battery, storage, memory and more. The handset comes preinstalled with third party apps that can be uninstalled.. Conclusion. The Samsung Galaxy M31 is certainly a new high for the series. The company has offered upgrades in the right categories such as improved ultra-wide angle camera and a faster charging support. At a starting price of Rs 13999, the device covers all bases well enough and has its strengths in battery and display. Even with tough competition in the category, the Samsung Galaxy M31 would certainly stand out from the crowd.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Recently apple was accused for reducing performance of Smartphone over period of time. When Smartphone antutu is coming same as this one. Than how oneplus 3t is hanging, i dont understand. Oneplus also accused for manipulating antutu benchmark, maybe that antutu benchmark i am getting is fake. Maybe software making Smartphone slow. Maybe it was happening because of aging SOC and other semi conductor. Initially that phone was good enough to handle task. But it became slow overtime.. Whatever , leave it. Thats why i choose non chinese Smartphone this time.. Samsung galaxy m31 is great for day to day task.. Pros :-. -Amazing screen better than my last smartphone. Samsung supply screen to many companies. So, samsung in champion in screen sector.. -exynos 9611 (10nm) is good processor, enough to handle daily tasks and good amount of gaming. I testes new asphalt game, running smoothly.. - 64mp camera is amazing, those people who r saying that its bad , are foolish dont know anything about camera.. -Wide angle camers is ok ok, not so good. Wide images are getting weird distortion stretches around the cornors.. -macro camera is ok too.. - amazing battery life, my oneplus 3t had poor battery even when it was new, this m31 can work for 24hr on light usage and low brightness. 12-15 hour on medium usage and low brightness. 10hr high usage and low brightness.. - i didn't experience any heating issue or lagging.. -smartphone comes with android 10 with oneUI 2.5, also getting regular updates.. Cons :-. -Not so thin, and Smartphone big too, not easy to handle for small hands but it is subjective cons.. - glasstic back is smooth like glass but it can be attract scratch easily, use cover, and cover will increase weight and width too.. - at back of the panel, around camera some glue were coming out of casing, it was manufacturing defect but i clean it myself.. - charging speed of 15w for this huge battery is not good, oneplus 3t was very fast. This takes 2hr+ to charge.. - phone battery has desgin capacity of 5830mah and 5314mah real capacity, this is normal among all Smartphone, it was same in oneplus. Batteries 90% efficient.

My personal favorite was the Galaxy S6 Edge, which I still use as a backup phone till date.. I have convinced more than a dozen people to buy Samsung phones saying how reliable the phones were.. But this phone has broken all trust in the Samsung phones as a whole.. Problems with this phone:. 1. Filled with non-sense BLOATWARE from the beginning.. Have to spend few hours in removing all this unwanted and extremely irritating material.. ""Dear Samsung, we can download the apps we want in Android, please don't spit dirty apps in right in our face."". 2. Battery life is not as good as advertised (FALSE ADVERTISING). Mi phones with 5000mAh batteries beat the battery life of this phone.. 3. Camera is poor (if not pathetic).. 4. Fingerprint sensor in rear and DOES NOT WORK most of the time.. 5. The phone has completely frozen and hung up four times since the day of purchase.. So every month I have to deal with rebooting the phone using volume and reset keys.. 6. Touch screen glitches many times.. 7. The in-call volume has suddenly reduced today, to the point that I can't hear the other person on the line.. So how many more un-pleasant surprises has Samsung planned for their customers.. At this point they should just come to our doorstep to exhort money from us and then beat us in the head.. I am done with Samsung.. I am returning this phone and never buying Samsung phones again.. As a matter of fact, I am going to actively discourage people from ever buying Samsung phones again (this is not going to be difficult since most people have also faced issues, so not difficult to convince)..

After having the low end phone and using it for a quite long time I decided to switch to high end phone because of poor service and privacy issues.. To get the best deal from the top bands it's really difficult so here we have it. Samsung Galaxy M31. Being a student I look for budget friendly phone and also to have a win to win feel after the purchase.. Here are some of specs. 1) Battery- it is truly exceptional,. You can use use it for even two days of high usage of phone.. Being a student I have used this phone for houres and only kept on charging at the 2nd day after being fully charged.. It takes around 2.5 to 2.9 hours to get fully charged.. 2 Camera - camera is really really good and does its job in truly exceptional way it also does support 4K video recording being a youtuber I really like the camera,. front camera is also the same which have high resolution but during the night you could face some drops.. The amoled screen is one of the best and is really catchy the colours seem to be clear and really natural.. And many more features if you switch from low end and phone you will experience a whole lot difference with this device.. The only problem which I faced, is - during the update, phone gets heated up.. It takes 2 to 6 mins to cool down.. And no more further problems were faced. Being a student I have a very high usage on this phone I mainly use this for my work and for my studies I do not use it for games so please do not consider my review on bias of games. But the features reamain same. It is one of the best deals i have ever had. For professional use i give it. 9/10 😌. Really happy with the purchase",5.0 out of 5 stars

As mentioned/responded (by others) in other reviews, camera quality can be adjusted to suit your needs, so those complaining about the picture quality, check the settings. Phone does heat up, during long video calls. No heating experienced during long voice calls. Fully charged battery life lasts easily for 36 hours at least, with usual usage (including games and video calls). Charging happens within 2:30 minutes.. Problems I am facing:. 1.

725,Reviewed in India on 13 November 2020,Rajkamal Prabhu,A Great Phone....,"It's a great phone to buy on Big sales or Deep discount sales days. The phone is definitely worth buying for 19K or less but not beyond that. The Exynos processor is what made me think twice. Would have been great if they had SD processor. Nonetheless Exynos does a decent job but definitely nowhere near Qualcomm SD.. Pros. * Amoled - Display is pretty good. * Camera - Camera is extremely good for a phone priced at 19k. * Sound - Not that clear/sharp while attending calls but Ok, not bad either. * Battery - super good.. lasts 1 day on heavy use and 2days for normal use. cons. * Processor - Exynos instead of SD. * Battery charging - says fast charging but takes at least 2.5 hours for full charge. * Packaging - No laminated one time use screen protector (the laminated kind of sheet) is provided. Tempered glass has to be put immediately after receiving to prevent unnecessary scratches or damages.. * Silicon Cover - it would hardly cost 10/- or 20/- for the manufacturer, they should have provided a basic mobile cover. * Audio - not that great even with Samsung headphones..listening to music won't be a great experience even if you enable Dolby or whatever the feature it has got. * Screen size - 6.7 inches would have been better. * Bloatware - Too many bloatware..unnecessary and annoying.

One thing to note here is that when I received the package the mobile was already switched on. However, no further setup was initiated (and no other damage or whatsoever).. Ok, coming onto my problems with the phone.. - The phone is fully plastic build and feels utterly cheap. (Considering the price point, I would not expect more. So , let's pass). - Another thing is the performance. I literally feel betrayed. The phone crashes when playing low end games like among us. Sometimes it needs to be rebooted due to this. And yes, talking about the reboot, the phone automatically reboots time and again (happened 6 times in 9 days).. - The charger cable and the charger. Cheap Cheap and Cheap. It feels like a 90rs cable that you pick from a chinese shop present on the roadside.. - Not a big fan of the huge bottom chin (It is just personal preference.).. - The battery backup is on point and the camera is ok-ish.. - The screen is also on par and I like it. I also like the One-UI from samsung.. - The fingerprint sensor is snappy and is blazing fast.. - The side buttons for volume and power are tactile and has good click to it.. - And yes, kudos for the good old headphone jack.. Atleast, now I know never to get a budget samsung product ever again.",1.0 out of 5 stars
727,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,Jai Praful Ved,Samsung M31 6GB + 128GB,"This is an amazing product.. Battery Life - with a proper usage with a couple of hours of gaming, calls, internet usage, videos, etc, the battery works well for one and half days. It works even better if in the night one puts it on battery saver mode.. Build - The phone build looks rugged. Its back is very smooth so feels like it will slip off the hand. The thickness is slightly more but its a compromise for the large battery it holds.. Camera - the output is really good and crisp. Photo quality and videos quality is nice.. Sound - The phone has one speaker, but sound quality is really decent.. Cards - it has dedicated slots for 2 SIMs and a memory card. But with 128GB one would not need much !. I have eventually bought 4 of these for within the family and noticed some build issue. On the back camera, I observed that camera slot should be slightly out of the body. But when I checked one phone, I saw that the level was merged with the back cover. That is a concern for me. With this, I actually noticed the same on the other phones and realised that the back cover needs to be pressed a little to allow the camera slot to pop out.. Now I am afraid that this could be manufacturing defect.. I also had a passing comment from one of the amazon delivery guys that the phone is the most commonly returned phones these days. But thankfully it is not for us for the moment.",5.0 out of 5 stars
728,Reviewed in India on 30 May 2021,Amazon Customer,"Charging sucks. Otherwise, a very good phone to own.","I found everything fine with this phone.. Good :. 1. Battery life. Found it to be good (40+ hours considering low - moderate usage). 2. I'm not too savvy about the response time of the fingerprint reader and the face unlock, but it was reasonably good. 3. Performance - found that for my usage - largely browsing, binge watching and very little of gaming, not the heavy ones), it never slowed down.. 4. Migration : the best and the easiest one through one of the Samsung apps. All I had to do was install it on my other device, which was a MI one and the entire migration just took a couple of hours (data, apps, and everything). 5. Display is very good.. 6. Personally, I liked the color and construct of the phone very much.. Average :. 1. Haven't tested the camera fully yet, but I found it really good in parts and pretty average in parts. Will post a detailed review again.. 2. The phone is damn heavy and it is so smooth that you find it tough to manage (risk of a slip and fall from your hands) without a screen guard and a back cover, which makes it even more heavier and bulkier.. Ugly :. 1. Charging : while the description says 15 W charger, but what is given in the box is a simple 5W charger and it takes an eternity to reach full charge. Really irritating in a day where fast charging is a norm.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Most of you friends and family using JIo will not be able to call you in a single attempt.. 6) Poor Samsung Keyboard.

I have recorded videos for youtube..loved the inbuilt mic audio quality!. Totally loved the video stabilization!. I was able to get decent macro shots!. Clicked pictures look natural & colorful.. Can't wait to explore other modes of camera!. Chinese applications like Helo, Tik Tok are preinstalled..a little disappointing.. The camera quality could've been better...Pictures were pixelated...changed the quality of capturing images..got decent results...later I installed Google cam, works perfectly...enables to click crisp pictures.. The USB cable is small and it's a bit annoying.. Thinking of getting a fast charger as the one provided with device is just 15W. Back cover is not provided in the box.. Bought Samsung (it's mentioned that this device has been manufactured in India) as I had decided not to go for any Chinese brands and I have no regrets!

I think in this price no any phone has battery backup of 6000mah.. and really its battery is outstanding. Same thing with its main camera I.es 64 mega pixel. A Superb camera quality .. It has failed ONe plus 7t phone camera .. so best phone in this much price.. I want to explain it's some feature as below. 1stly Battery 5star. 2ndly camera 64mega pixel - 5star , There is a slow motion vedio making function enabled in the camera , which is really good.. 3rd Front camera - 4star.. 4th Processor - 4star. 5th RAM - 5star I.es 6GB ram is best for Heavy application.. 6th Touches - As samsung is famous for its smooth touch so - 5star. Really awesome touch. 7th - Dark mode and blue light filter are also included - 4star. These all ratings are out of 5.. Now REMEDIES / DRAWBACK of this phone is. 1st - It has non metal bodies, so u can't use it rough and tough .. 2ndly - little bit Heating problem during the charging of phone, and using heavy memory game, or any any Heavy software.. 3rd - it's back side camera is little bit outside , so there is a maximum chance of scratch.. 4th - heavy weighted phone. Phone should be slim , but it is not a slim phone, it has much high thickness.. Overall , If someone want to buy A phone @15000, And also He/she is interested in photography , and need a long more battery backup then One's should must go to this phone. But if someone want a rough n tough phone . Then he/ she may avoid , as it is a non metallic body shaped phone.. And heating problem of the phone cause a huge effects..",4.0 out of 5 stars

757,Reviewed in India on 17 July 2020,Pika13,If not chinese then this.,"My previous two phones were Redmi note 3 and Redmi note 5 pro mainly because of the specs it offered and was th best option available that time. Well my heart wanted to again buy a Redmi phone again but mind did not allow that maybe anti China sentiments(not naive) and thought of using something different. Lets test try the change.. They increased the price of the phone by 1000 rs during lockdown and it did hurt me but I still went ahead with the phone. I am using 8GB 128GB model. (Rs19500). It cost me 2k to 3k compared to other phones but dimag tha jo mann nai raha tha.. Amazing battery. It definitely last a days use and I mean it even when you use it extensively apart from gaming. Surfing, videos, movies , you can do alot of other thing it will last 20 -28 hours and battery wont disappoint you.. Security: i felt more secured using a Samsung phone than the redmi phones that i have used earlier. This is something personally what i have felt.. Camera: Camera quality is good and i did not get lags while clicking pictures. Honestly I do not click much pictures so this does not really matter to me.. Display and Touch: Display is fine but screen gets streched, related to resolution mainly so you may not be a able to see the score of football matched on the left corner, or youtube subtitles in the full screen mode. Touch could haven better i felt and more quick.. Performance: I did find issues here and i am really disappointed with the performance even though i compensated with higher ram i do feel lag while opening apps switching between apps, handling multiple task and lag here and there. I am bit skeptic not sure how much the performance degradation will happen down the line. The performance is not seamless and not upto the mark. could have been better.. Ui: i am not enjoying the samsung ui and it is complicated and it does not have basic features of spamming callers or catergorzing or app lock and takes time to search through the settings option(major lag there). The navigation is difficult. I really enjoyed miui.. Sound Quality: Decent not amazing not bad..okaish it wont thrill you. Could have been better.. Gaming: I am not using this phone for gaming and not sure how it work but i think it wouldnt be a great performer with high end graphic games.. For me Battery and Performance, ui should be top notch. that is my only requirement. 5 for battery, 3 for performance and 2.5 for ui..

Although when you plug-in it says ""Fast charging"" it still takes approx 3.5-4 hours to fully charge. Too slow in my opinion.. 2) Some of the preloaded apps from Samsung are very annoying. Specially the camera app has one very bad feature. After you record a video and want to see it, it starts playing automatically. If you want to scrool forward, backward, pause etc, there is no control. It has to open the video again using a different app and then you can control. Such an annoying thing.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Good selfie camera. Rear camera has wide view points. Network and connectivity is good. Light weight. Easy to handle. Good design. Fingerprint censor is safe and has good security.. Cons:. 64mp camera is not that much good compare to other phones. Using Pixel binning technology not real 64mp. Captured image detailing very less.. Slow motion video has very poor quality.

Superb AMOLED display. 2.Excellent battery life. 3.Decent performance. 4.Good photo quality in daylight. Cons :-. 1.Disappointing low-light camera performance but might be fixed with system update.. 2.Spammy notifications. 3.Average video stabilisation but might be fixed with system update. Overall Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you. The smartphone comes under the budget segment but it doesn’t look like one.!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Just some minor issues: it doesn't have Knox security, its plastic back can easily invite scratches, Samsung could have improved the charging quality and its processor too and it doesn't have a screen recording feature or link to windows feature. The 32mp front camera is not good as good as expected it gives you the quality of a 15 to 20mp camera.. It really has a super battery life, very nice rear quad camera with plenty of new features, amazing display, the fingerprint sensor and the face unlock is superfast and it gives you a nice performance..

763,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,Amazon Customer,A Great Value For Money Product,"This phone has an excellent display, which is good to look at even outdoors when the sun is shining brightly. The display quality makes it an excellent multimedia phone too. The signal reception and call quality are pretty good. The speakerphone does the job. The best part about the device is its battery life. It lasts a day even with close to heavy use, involving much web browsing, a lot of movie viewing, and listening to many audio files. The device has a great camera for its price. I am not that interested in camera, but my shutterbug friends told me that the pictures taken through it are good. Another valuable feature is Dolby Atmos, which improves the sound output quality of the Bluetooth speaker connected to it.. I do not have any flaws to say regarding the device. A slight quibble is that the back panel catches fingerprints quite easily, but using a back case solves it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Even in a bit darker room, its able to recognize if you bring your phone a little closer.. Battery is 6000 mah. With full 100 percent charge, It will easily work fine upto 2 days. Given that you're not using much wifi and data.. Camera quantity is good but not that great.. The main camera is 64mp. But when you zoom in the pic, sometimes the pixels get distorted.. The wide angle camera is amazing. Although it's just 8mp, but the picture quality is really amazing. Captures 123 degrees wide.. Macro and Depth Camera is 5mp. The picture quality and pixel is great. The focus on the main about is really good.. Video quality is amazing. Even when you're walking or driving, the video is quite stable. So really love the video stabilization.. Slow motion works really fine. Only thing is in the normal video the brightness is a bit more. But in the slow motion, the video is a little bit dull.. But overall the camera is really great..

My location, Bluetooth, is always on for fitness band so with all these + fb, YouTube, insta , regular browsing, WhatsApp, pubg for 2-3 hours, i still get 25 - 35% at the night or next day morning, this is the best thing about this Mobile (Full Paisa wasoool hai 💯). ~ 6gb Ram is quite good- nowadays u need atleast 6gb for smooth working, i haven't seen any hanging issues till now even after rough use believe me. ~ ONE UI 2.0 : I normally prefer clean stock android phones like Motorola, all my previous phones were from Motorola but u know it sucks now so wanted buy mid range with near clean stock android phone, so this my 1st Samsung Mobile, earlier i never liked Samsung because of there UI, but with ONEUI all is fine u get android 10 with all the Google features.. ~ Performance is also good.

And at the end it finally switched on after an hour. This issue did not happened for 1 time after 2 to 3 days interval it happens again and again.. I went to service center they asked me to format it and it will get solved. I did it and the issue still persists.. Now coming to screen quality of Rs 17k phone. it came off from my hand and fell down 2 ft maximum not even more than that the screen got a crack.. This how samsung is making phones.

When any other phone has full range on 4g, M31 kept just besides it has only 1 line of range. And this is not just with this handset, but a very common problem. Google this issue and you will come across hundreds on people complaining about this on Samsung's page.. Well, due to this, even internet and calls don't work properly. So the phone gets reduced to a camera basically.. 2) The fingerprint sensor needs atleast 3-4 attempts to open. Having used Redmi which needs just a fraction of second to open, this is a nightmare. Painful.. Very much regret buying this.",1.0 out of 5 stars
779,Reviewed in India on 28 May 2020,Arun Vadekkedhil,A very VFM MidRanger,"My previous phone had a cracked LCD and was on the lookout for a new phone. Thanks to the lockdown, had lots of time on my hand to review most phones, get firsthand accounts from friends and then make a choice.. To be honest, my first preference was the OP8 and was looking for video reviews when I stumbled upon this phone. Samsung seems to have packaged a decent bit of hardware and specifications on this phone which gets most of your job done.. Disclaimer: If you are an avid gamer, then this is not for you unless you are ready to make trade offs. What I Like the most:. 1. Comes with Android one UI v2. The phone has a near bloat free experience and very close to stock android. However, some of the features are masked by Samsung, I'm if those will be available in higher end or flagship models like S20 / S20 Note etc. However, loving the features like Dark mode, use Camera flash for notification, ability to capture more than one face etc.. 2. Amazing display, the AmOLED display is a pleasure to view and even can be used under direct sunlight.. 3. The phone comes with support for two sims and SD card, which is good for avid music lovers like me to stash and carry my ever-growing collection of music & videos.. 4. Samsung switch App, for once I have a product from Samsung which does the job without any fuzz. Was able to transfer my data from my broken phone using this.. 5. The Camera is of decent quality, so far, the pictures have turned out well, but still exploring so will reserve my comments for now.. What I don’t like. 1. 6000 MAH battery adds to the weight but gives the same performance as my old phone 4000 MAH battery. Could have tweaked battery usage. 2. The build is dated, and the naked phone may not draw any oohs & aahs from onlookers. Plastic body is prone to scratches and fingerprints, so better invest in a case.. 3. No headphones provided by Samsung, not sure if this is the trend, but a simple 100 Rs earphone could have enhanced the VFM perspective.. 4. Lastly the Exynos processor, so far, I’ve not notices any lag or slowness, but at times I feel that the phone is a tad unresponsive especially when I try to pull down the notification panel or try to dismiss a few apps.. Overall Verdict:. It’s a bargain buy with good specifications, recommend purchasing this.",4.0 out of 5 stars

800,Reviewed in India on 6 October 2020,bineesh,Display broke No Accessories available waiting for more than one month,Display is very poor it broken on a fall after only two weeks of use even with back cover and tampered glass and placed in a leather hand bag . And the worst is Samsung don’t a have its Accessories for M series display to get it replaced even at our own cost . Waiting for more than month . And the service center still don’t know when it can be repaired . The insurance also is of no use. Now the service center informed we have to handover the phone to them and they will try to a display replaced if not they give a coupon for the price after reducing the service charge and accessories charge .,1.0 out of 5 stars
801,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2020,SANDEEP,Samsung M31 8GB ..A BIG HEADACHE,This product is not at all worth buying. Phone gets too much heated even on minimum usage and while charging. It becomes like a hot plate....from screen as well as from back.. Moreover the return policy is very very cumbersome and difficult.. Services of Samsung authorized service center are also hopeless.. In nut shell... please don't buy this phone M31 .. My experience has been very very bad.. I'm running from pillar to post for last two days to get it checked at the service center but to no use.. I do not recommend this product at all.. With due apologies🙏🙏.,1.0 out of 5 stars
802,Reviewed in India on 3 June 2020,Anita S V,"Practical and balanced product, value for money. Safe buy - go for it!","Overall a very good buy considering the price and what the product offers. A solid product that has everything a practical user looks for - great battery, huge storage, fantastic camera, good response (haven't experienced any lags so far), not loaded with unnecessary OEM apps, solid build quality. There are though few areas of improvement - weight and thickness: heavier and thicker than its category counterparts (maybe due to the battery), doesn't look very glossy and upmarket, no add on accessories like a back cover and screen guard was provided like few brands do, the battery doesn't last as long as one would expect given that it's a massive 6000mah (but nevertheless I'm happy - maybe in the initial few days I was heavily downloading data and transferring files etc.), the screen touch response is great .. maybe not as awesome as an iPhone (but so is the price 😀). The fingerprint sensor needs to be a bit more responsive.. Overall for a user like me who places practically over bling value, and who doesn't want to spend over 20k on a phone it's easily a 4 or even 4.5 stars. SAFE BUY!!! 👍",4.0 out of 5 stars

If I comapred to my earlier oppo F11 where fast charging charger took only 55to 60mins to get full charged.

The blue color is amazing and the performance is adequate for regular use. I am not high on gaming and media on phones and hence this is more than adequate for someone looking to primarily use a phone for browsing and other productive work apart from calls and texts.. The Samsung interface is not very intuitive but it works. The display is clear and bright and the scrolling is smooth. Feels premium to hold and behaves like one.,4.0 out of 5 stars

I bought a 6 GB Variant with 128 GB internal storage.. The day it came it was fine. Working fine. Now its.been about a month i have been using it... My Reviews for camera .... CAMERA QUALITY IS JUST FINE but the features given like AR DOODLE etc are amazing.... BATTERY LIFE IS ABOUT 1 AND A HALF DAY of normal usage. Gestures are amazing. PROCESSOR is kinda slow which leads to lagging sometimes especially when using AR Doodle and Of course during PUBG .. Normal Heating Issue not that big of a problem. There is a slight network problem with this phone as i compared it with my 2 friends phones. Overall the processor could have been much better.

This app can translate any text, for example newspaper text, any unknown language you don't understand while travelling, just point your phone towards it when starting bixby vision, it'll show you translated text in the display in realtime, search for any product or image I see online (for example, focus it on your speakers or headphone and it will show you it's details, price etc..

But now after more than a year of use I have encountered a very frustrating problem. After installing updates when you start using the phone it keeps on rebooting. Both times I went to service center and they said will require a fresh installation of the operating system which they did free of cost but after each reinstall I had to spend several hours installing apps and restoring data. They advised me stop automatic updates. I didn't like that idea but when it happened the second time I have done so.

Bought on 6th Aug 2020 and Got delivered on 8th Aug 2020.. After searching and lot of research, zero down on this phone and it just gone beyond my expectation. This comes from a very reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'd used other brands of mobile also, but my experience with Samsung has been most consistent compared to other mobile brands.. Pros:. - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!. - Display is excellent with Blue light filter.. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.. - 6000 Mah Maha- battery is BIG. I charge almost after 50-55 hours of heavy usage. (Online classes, games, videos, web series, chats, social media etc). - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE. - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. Completely charge from 0 to 100% almost in 2-2.5 hrs max.. - Mobile speakers sound is good, loud and clear, good for Senior Citizens also for clear sound.. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - photos of Samsung Galaxy M31 are from Samsung Galaxy M21 (another super powerhouse phone from Samsung). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good. Cons:. - very sleekly, though not that thin.. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex. - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.80 cover was good enough.. Overall Feedback:. - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.. Go for it without any doubt.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Battery goes more than 24hrs, I use comparatively less than an insta/fb/Twitter person, but more often I keep checking messages and few videos. With full charging, it says low battery after some 30 hours, so battery life is real great.. Cons. But charging takes long time. Adapter has the Fast Charging sign, but to make us fool. It take around 2 hours for full charging which I feel is really long.. Processor being Exynos and 6GB Ram, I feel the performance is quite poor. Phone is slow in operation. Not satisfying..

Anyone who wants to buy non Chinese get this phone. Samsung manufactures everything outside of China in this phone. Very good screen. Best camera of any phone very used. Good camera. Very customizable UI. Highly recommend it if you are someone who is in say a 25k budget i would still ask you to buy this and spend that money on something else like wireless earbuds or something. I bought a spiwgen case and a POPIO screen protector with the phone and it feels just like a 1+7 or I reckon even 1+7t pro. The only reason you should go higher is. 90hz top of the line display.

840,Reviewed in India on 16 May 2021,Ashutosh C.,Average Product in this price range.,"This product from Samsung is of average quality. The build quality is not good as compared to the phones of Realms, RedMI of the same range.. Processor is awesome. Very fast senses of touch. Camera quality is average and lens of the camera captures slightly blurr image when you zoom and click. Battery Life is not as per the product description. Overall a very average phone at this price range.. I love Samsung electronics and its product and have been a regular user. But Samsung needs to think again at lower end variants of mobile phones.",3.0 out of 5 stars
841,Reviewed in India on 20 January 2021,M X Mathew,Frequent hanging issue with the device. Also re-boots automatically,"The phone started auto shutdown and hanging frequently in 6 months of purchase. Checked on Google and found that it was a common problem with many buyers. Obviously a company like Samsung was not oblivious to such rampant criticism of its not so cheap device.. To add to the problem, the customer care gave me the details of service centre nearby with a phone number which was out of service for many months, as several people commented on the website. The on-line appointment facility provided online for visiting the customer care was not allowing to choose the date and time!. Pathetic!. All said, Allah malik!",2.0 out of 5 stars
842,Reviewed in India on 29 May 2020,Ekanath R,The best smartphone you can get in this price range,"There are several pros for M31. But since it's already covered by other reviewers and YouTube videos, I'll instead point out some not-so-common cons (if at all you can call them cons!). 1. The phone does not come with a backcover and it is a fingerprint magnet. So you would need to buy a backcover for aesthetics.. 2. Not water resistant (is that asking too much?😅). 3. It does take a bit of time to get fully charged. But once that's done, it'll easily last for more than a day.. 4. The earphone slot is at the bottom of the phone. I personally like it on the top. Again, it wouldn't be a bother if you use a Bluetooth earphone/headset. :). 5. This might not be the phone for heavy gamers.. I haven't found any other problem after a month's usage.. Overall, I totally recommend this phone. 😊. P.S - I saw some reviews saying the camera quality is poor. I disagree to it as I feel it's really good.",5.0 out of 5 stars

My kids use this phone for online classes for almost 4 hours even it requires only 2 days once charging. Kudos Samsung. Apps performance is very good.

They even took 6 days to deliver but ""it was better late than never"" and I received a Awesome product.. Coming to the device, it's the best that Samsung could provide with all these features for this price range (almost a flagship kind of feel).. Processor - at first I felt that it was bit slow, but after a use of a day or two, I could realize that it was learning your daily usage pattern and it delivers a smooth performance.. Camera - best quality images from all the cameras in good lighting condition. Fingerprint sensor - if you think it as slow, you're wrong, it's just very accurate. Battery - you can survive more than a day with normal usage. Display - I'm a fan; crisp display and the punch hole camera doesn't interfere with your entertainment, you almost feel it as invisible. Overall it's an Awesome device; You'll have a great feel with this device",5.0 out of 5 stars

848,Reviewed in India on 14 August 2020,Rohit kabdwal,"Overall Good Phone, Front Camera quality Not good Enough","Device is overall good, But I must say that camera quality is not upto the level I was expecting it being a 64MP camera phone.. Front camera photography is a not good in dark and images appear very grainy. Talking about image processing Colors are oversaturated and during video calls you could see a yellow tint. This underperformance of the front camera is because of the notch design as there is less space in the front for another camera/ flash.. The rear camera is somewhat good in photography and and the videography is pretty good.. Bloatwares. With this phone Samsung has targeted the budget phone section as they were falling behind the likes of other Chinese manufacturers. Though they have packed this phone with massive features but it comes with a trade off i.e. Bloatwares and sponsored app downloads. If you are wise enough to bypass those app promotions you can happily use this phone.. Overall, I am satisfied with the phone because I didn't want to go for Chinese companies. But still I miss Good front camera.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Who can buy this and why:. Best Screen at this price: Amoled screen is out of the wold. Who love watching videos/movie specially while on the go. Camera: camera is one of the best ( not as best as oppo or vivo) But, definitely better than redmi. Macro is better than any othe phone.. Battery: Who has long usage. Fetches 2days battery life easily. ( But not suitable for hardcore gamers ). UI: very light and we'll managed. Good in long run ( But not as good as funtouch). No lags at all. Speakers are fairly good. But not too loud.. Samsung brand value, service and resell values are very good. Updates are assured.. Finger print sensor is pretty fast. Data safety is the key reason why one needs to buy this phone.. Cons: face unlock is little slow. Slightly heavier but, considering battery size it's nothing. Price is slightly higher than it is supposed to be. But screen quality will make forget it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Worst Selfie camera, 32mp selfie camera giving below 10mp quality in room light conditions. In day light also selfies are not at all sharp.. Don't go for this mobile if you want to shoot nice videos, M31 has a serious problem with focussing while taking videos. Most of the videos taken in this phone are giving some glitch effects as the camera sensor is always confused and tempts to focus on everything which results in a very poor video output.. Battery is 6000 mah, But it will take more than 3hrs to charge as it doesn't have a fast charging option..

The next is the camera quality it’s really outperform as compare to anything which rate me as to offer. Next the overall hamlet screen over here is much better as compare to redmi note 9 pro max..

884,Reviewed in India on 3 June 2020,Mubarak,Samsung M31 is a Great Smartphone fully loaded with all the Latest Features and High Specifications,"M31 is equipped with all the features what one wish to have in mobile. After reviewing all makes and comparison, I choose to have M31 and I must say, my decision was not wrong. Amazon delivered the product before their committed date. 6gb Ram, 128gb Storage, Octa core, 64MP quad Camera is more than enough. Functional Performance is very good. 6000mah Battery performance is too good. No need to charge even for next day. Camera also delivers good picture quality throughout day and night. Sensors like Biometric & Compass are very useful. I am truly enjoying M31. Samsung has indeed done a great job by launching M series compared to other make mobiles at very competitive price.",5.0 out of 5 stars

886,Reviewed in India on 13 March 2020,Amazon Customer,Not recommend,Phone is not recommended. During calls I am facing few issues like call recording will start automatically or call will go on hold. These could be due to sensitivity issues and placement of additional menu close to face touch. Never faced these issues in my prior mobiles.. Review after 10 months. With my above comments I went to service center where they claim that mother board has been replaced but still had my issues as before. So I do not trust service center's statement.. Now have written to Samsung CEO desk. Let's see if they are concerned about the same and thier brand value.,2.0 out of 5 stars
887,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Nadeem Shah,Mega Monsters review - Go for it,"Review after 4 days usage:. The phone is very good in terms of what it offers for 16 thousand mid range segment. Pros,cons and final verdict below.. Pros:. 1. Camera is solid. Far better then any other mobiles in this segment. Live focus,slow motion and other features work perfectly. Have attached live focus,normal pick, normal video and slowmo. If you want great camera performance this is the mobile. 2. Battery is wonderful, no need to tell it's a beast 6000 Mah. 3. Display is crisp and very sensitive. 4. Game play is also great, pubg works well in normal graphics. 5. Build is also very good, not as bad as they are reviewed it's a decent build for this segment but not much smudge proof. Use back cover.. Cons:. 1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day. 2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers. Will check further and update.. Final verdict is to go for the mobile if you are keen on camera, display and battery. For game play pubg note 8 pro might perform well in graphics side but this does a decent job as well. It worth it guys, its actually a mega monster #megamonster #sansung",5.0 out of 5 stars

889,Reviewed in India on 10 August 2020,Krishna Kumar Kowshik,Just the pros and cons,Pros:. 1. Great battery life. Reminiscent of the old nokia phones which never used to die.. 2. High quality display.. 3. Smooth and fluid performance.. Cons:. 1. Fingerprint reader non-responsive sometimes. 2. Camera quality is only decent. Pro mode does not give much options like ability to adjust aperture and shutter speed. Maybe you can get access to those from some other app in the play store.. 3. Touch unlock available but not touch lock which could lengthen the life of the power button. Again have to depend on some play store app for this.. Overall a great buy for anyone looking for fair performance and good battery life.,4.0 out of 5 stars

If there's strong network coverage, then you won't notice any difference.. Otherwise, it's a decent phone for at around 15k.",4.0 out of 5 stars
891,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,Mukesh,M stands for Must Buy,"This is my 3rd phone in Galaxy series. Galaxy series from Samsung is widely known for great phones with great features, but this one M31, is great even from Budget point of view. I did purchase on First Day First Show, when this was launched. Reason is number of reviews I had read on YouTube. Almost 20+ reviews I checked. I also read number of issues on Samsung forum / various blogs/forum etc. Every piece of information convinced, this is the best phone in this budget. Extreme value for Money.. My smartphone journey has been quiet diverse in terms of various companies, so I am able to compare / differentiate various features, with hands on experience.. From Year 2012 : Samsung Galaxy S2 > HTC Incredible 2 > HTC Rhyme > Samsung Galaxy Note 2 > LG G Vista > LG G6 > Redmi Note 3 > LG Q6 > Redmi Pro 6 > Samsung M31 : To year 2020.. Following is my experience with M31, after a month of usage.. Good: (for M31). - Android 10! Great looking version & beautifully customized by Samsung. Even in 10th edition, Samsung was fast to roll out update.. - Mammoth display, my kids can actually use it properly for school online classes, as screen is sufficient when viewed from near distance.. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.. - 6000 mAh battery is NEED of the times, with so much dependence on online activities. I use it full day + almost half of the time on HOT spot. Still, battery works for a 1.5 to 2 days. Charging is very fast, but not ultra fast. 30 min can increase around 50% battery.. - Both the SIM support 4G (that’s plus), as we can practically use 2 JIO SIM for almost double the data, without any switchover.. - Separate SD Card (up to 512 GB), actually is a great feature. Existing memory of 128 GB is sufficient as of now & SD cards (high capacity) are not cheap as such. So, Samsung did a right thing to provide enough memory from beginning.. - Mobile speakers is good for normal music (less bass) & conference call. You actually feel part of the room, when conference call over speaker.. - Camera is really good. So many features re there & I am yet to fully know them, as my basic usage is not for photography, but my children makes great video from this phone.. - Figure-print sensor response is good, but when finger is moist due to sweat / water, it doesn’t response. That’s problem with all the phone, but the moment you wipe your finger, you are good to go. Response time is ultra fast.. - Thanks Amazon for delivering within 3 days, even in partial lock down conditions.. Not So Good: (for M31). - Not thin & light. Additionally, I have put up a sturdy cover + glass, so weight increased heavily. After few days you get used to it.. - Doesn’t come with Samsung Security feature (like other galaxy series premium phone). However, Samsung does offer S-Secure app to lock certain apps with finger scan.. - To many Samsung related apps (like global goal etc) & many of them are still to be known what it does. But Samsung can reduce such apps to save memory. You can disable few of them.. - SMS can’t be deleted with a swipe (like in case of redmi),that’s important as many of the OTP/temporary messages should be deleted to reduce clutter.. - Mobile torch can’t be switched of with a phone power button. This is a required feature, instead of going to notification & switch off torch.-. - No light sensor in front, as it helps to avoid call going in hold during conversation. I read on Samsung forum, that front camera is used, so we have to hold phone in particular normal angle, that will ensure that call doesn’t get disturbed. Now, little used to it.. - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. Apps run like butter & it never gives a message of storage space running out, in spite of heavy storage.. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.. If you are looking for a sub 20k feature rich phone, go for M31/Samsung. As it is far batter than any other Chinese options available, which are good in flashy advertisement, but in long run performance, they can’t match Samsung. I have been user of",5.0 out of 5 stars
892,Reviewed in India on 16 February 2021,Rahul Raut,Good budget smartphone with chunky battery life.,"A great device for the people who doesn't hunger for deal-breaking performance, but needs battery life with good camera quality.. Pros:. 1. The most important feature is the massive battery. For me, overall battery life is about 1 and a half to 2 days. The maximum I've got is 13 hrs+ of screen on time, with 2 days and 10 hrs of standby time, from 100% to 1%.. 2. Given the size of the battery, the device is impressively lightweight. It feels, and looks premium to use.. 3. The Camera setup is good. The quality of the photographs is good, and to surprise, the low light performance is good. The addition of wide angle lens helps capture the things that main camera misses out, with slight downside of quality. Macro shots looks okay, but not that great. Front camera takes good photos, but the overall quality is acceptable.. 4. For budget device, it comes with really good display. Watching movies, TV series, etc. is good experience.. 5. Fingerprint scanner works fine, and it is bit too much sensitive.. 6. The audio output through 3.5 mm jack is good paired with Dolby Atmos.. Cons:. 1. Charging cable is very short. It's a total disappointment.. 2. Even with 15W charger, the phone takes solid 3 hrs to charge from 0 to 100%.. 3. Never been fan of Samsung's OS. The bloatware is bit too much.. 4. External speaker is not as loud as I expected to be, but it gets the job done.. 5. Images are bit too sharp from main camera. The Macro lens lacks the quality & shows it in low light.. 6. The back plastic can get scratched easily.. Final opinion: It is great device for someone who demands battery life, with few acceptable downsides.",4.0 out of 5 stars
893,Reviewed in India on 13 March 2020,Ankit,Great phone at great price,"This is honest review after 10 days of use. The phone looks promising with the features detailed in website. I am using 6 gb + 128 gb space black varient. Pros:. 1)super display- super amoled brings viewing experience to next level.. 2)mega battery- enough for full day heavy usage. People who are interested more in social media browsing, its a major advantage. You need not to worry for battery backup as this phone has a power bank inside.. 3) amazing camera- camera quality is just awsome. 64 mp camera adds life to images.. 4) samsung assurance - this product has samsung brand value and id supploes with high quality finish and long lasting durability. 5) no heating issue- even if you use phone for hours you would not feel any heating at the back.. Cons:. 1) slow charging - even though samsung claims to have equipped the device with fast charging then also actually phone take close to 1.5 hours for full charge from 30 % to 100%. This might be due to large battery size proportionaly making charging time to increase.. 2) missing led notification- though its not a major thing to note but could add value if provided.. 3) As claimed , processor is not blazing fast, though this phone is great for day to day useage but gamers may feel little disappointment while playing high resolution games.. Overall its a great budget phone for modrate users and media lovers.",5.0 out of 5 stars

896,Reviewed in India on 22 August 2020,Shakti Suman,Not best for day to day usage,"The first android phone that I bought was from Samsung way back in 2013 and after a horrible experience with it, I stopped buying Samsung phones. Between 2013 and 2020, I must have bought atleast 10 phones. This time I had to buy a Samsung only because I had to buy a non-Chinese brand and other non-Chinese brands' mobiles were out of stock. Bingo!, Samsung didn't fail to disappoint me this time too. 6000 mAh battery lasts me a day with almost 15% by 8PM after a full charge in the morning. I must mention that I don't play any games and I am a basic user. Just checking messages, making calls for around an hour and around 2 hours of You Tube or other video platforms. The last phone I used was priced at 7999 and it had around 50% battery at 8 PM. The inbuilt keyboard is one of the worst I have used. Read a lot of praises of One UI but its not good compared to others. Many apps like First Cry, Amazon take too much time to open from the Recents tab. So many extras installed. Screen I can't say as I mostly get to watch videos at max 720p, camera is a major upgrade over my last used phone so I liked it. Fingerprint reader and face recognition are good. Call quality is Good. Speaker volume is Ok for ringing for incoming calls but not OK for watching movie unless you have vulcsn hearing or there is pin drop silence around you. I have to put my hand over the speaker grills sometimes while watching movie. PS: No, I can't use ear phones. There's a baby at home. Have to put an ear to him too.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I use mostly online shopping apps, Streaming apps, chat, video calls.. Pros. 1. SAMOLED screen, Pleasing to look..... 2. Battery life, for me with moderate use it lasts for 2 days.. 3. Camera Front and Back. Especially I love the Front camera...For selfie lovers it is a boon. Back camera is good but I can spot some color deviations in pictures taken using back camera as the real color is not seen in picture. But for me it is not an issue as I not using it frequently.. 4. Stylish looks.. 5. No major heating issues as I could see persons having competitors mobiles are complaining a lot about this.. 6. Even after 20 to 30 drops I dont see any visible even minor damage to the screen or body. Very well built device.. Cons,. 1. Finger peint sensor and face recognition takes bit longer time then competitors devices to detect.. 2. Plastic body behind is fingerprint magnet and also can be easily scratched with out case. I dont like using a case so it is a issue for me.Even if you use a case you have to choose a good quality one as the bad ones themselves leave some scratches in long use. 3. Charging time...I know it is directly proportional to battery capacity but bit more faster charging would have been handy. Tome charging times are 3 hours 15 mins with normal charging and 2 hours 35 mins with fast charging.. 4. Whenever there is a software update mobile also shows a list of recommended apps that should be installed to complete the update. This came skipped but still it is annoying.. Gamers.. please forgive me as I am not going to mention anything regarding the gaming performance as I have never tried even a single game with this mobile.. Mobile is worth the money and my Rating is easily above 4 but if metal case and bit more faster charging options are provided I will be happily rate it 5..

Camera pixels is just a number. 64mp is not up to the mark. 32mp selfie camera is also bad. processor wise the phone is slow with a old exynos processor.

For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.. (c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.. (d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.. (e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.. (f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.. (g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.. CONS. (a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge.. (b) Samsung KNOX isn't preinstalled. So, you can't use ""Secure Folder"". Need to install ""S Secure"" app for app lock.. (c) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.. (d)Call quality isn't that great. (e)You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides.

910,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Bhavana,Great battery life with a good camera,"I have been using this phone for the last 2 months. I was using the Oneplus 7T before. I am not a heavy gamer and use my device to binge-watch, click photos and use the social media apps so won't comment much on the performance. The camera to my surprise almost competed with 7T's even though it's half of it's price point.. Pros:. 1. Camera - I find the camera to be pretty good at this price point. Both the front and back cameras have good depth. The macro camera could be a bit better but does the job for a budget smart phone. I have attached photos I clicked (clearly not a good photographer), the first is of a odd little spider using the macro camera, the 2nd and 3rd of the 64 MP camera and the 4th of the front camera. 2. Amoled display. 3. The battery life lasts for the full day easily even though I use my phone at long stretches.. 4. 2 sim card and an separate sd card holder - I am one of those people who watches a lot of classic movies and hence need the extra storage so this bodes well for me and I also have 2 phone numbers (work cell and personal cell). 5. Not a Chinese brand.. Cons-. 1. It's on the heavier side understandably with the 6000 mah battery. 2. The charger should have been at least of 25 amperes.

I had read a similar review on Amazon about getting dust under plastic cover.. Initially I suspected the cameras of the phone and the camera panel seems to be slightly displaced. Camera quality is the worst. My friend has the same phone but he's camera is good. I suspect that the original parts of this phone that I've received are siphoned. please please don't buy this phone from Amazon. They've got the worst retailers. Regretting buying this phone. The fingerprint sensor has stopped working. In just 2 months. The original parts of this phone have been removed. Like cameras and fingerprint sensor and speakers. Can't believe this.

914,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Shivani gautam,Why  I switched 9promax to M31 .,"Camera :- Not That Much great as redmi note 9 pro max but the video option of it does provide you a great stability which not any other brand can gave u in this price point . Remember not great as redmi note 9 pro max only otherwise no other phone can beat this one under 17k.. Feature :- Absolutely Loaded with lots of feature it does provide you the always on display great wallpapers on your lockscreen and its display is soo amazing . I'm sure u guys know what amoled display feels like and in terms of display samsung. Always wins because of no compromises on their displays .. Battery Life - You believe it or not but every day I charged my phone in night and every next day I'll use my phone about 10 hours a day and still its battery is more then 60 percent . And in lockdown we all know what we use more .. Gaming performance - I'll played pubg in first few weeks and my experience Is much better then other realms or Xiaomi devices as i played pubg in redmi note 9 pro max too but that display n that phone is horrible in app management and m31 performance is smooth .. At last all I want to say Is it's all up to guys what phone u prefer but if u guys loves a great display ,feature rich phone , Wants to record video with a great stability so this phone is for u go for its .... and please guys remember one thing display matters",5.0 out of 5 stars

926,Reviewed in India on 24 July 2020,Neellohit Bose,A Perfect Professional & Corporate phone with really nice look,"The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support.. I'm giving this review after using 1 week.. Pros:. Camera : The Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup at the back and a single 32-megapixel selfie shooter. The primary camera on the Galaxy M31 has a 64-megapixel resolution and f/1.8 aperture. This camera takes 16-megapixel binned shots by default but you can switch to the full resolution. There's also an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree field of view and an f/2.2 aperture.. Battery : I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again. 2.5 hours to full chrage.. Games:. If you are a professional gamer, I suggest you to go for MI brand. MI provides slightly better graphics. Overall gaming experience is nice on M31. Cons:. Nothing as of now. Note : When I plugged into charging phone will slightly heatup.. I bought it 2 Phones as 6GB and 8GB with 128GB storage.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Pros - very fast, good for high end mobile gaming - Prepare to get glued to ur screen. Screen - beautiful and bright, there's a noticeable difference between my previous handset which is an LCD and the SAmoled. Camera - just wonderful. Battery life - good, but that doesn't mean you should stick to your phone. Please let it, let its steam off. RAM - Blazing fast. Charger - very good, takes roughly an hour to full charge. What could have been better-. Fingerprint Sensor could have locked the phone. Screen isn't really scratch proof, which is understandable considering it's a 3. Plastic body.

Huge battery capacity and still light weight. Good rear and front camera. Excellent screen display. Very nice sound quality on speaker. and earphones. Has lot of customization features. And most of all Ads Free.. Phone cons. Cannot log into google account on the very first time, you will spend your entire first day with debugging like wifi internet won't work and list goes on regardless of the latest software update.. Samsung factory apps cannot be deleted and have to change the settings to stop automatically install apps without consent and unnecessary notifications.. Processor is slow, so things take a while to function sometimes, even if u have the 6GB ram like YouTube videos double touch sometimes doesn't work to 10sec rewind or fast forward the video, fingerprint unlock is not competitivelly fast but can live with it and other apps where rarely touch will work on lag. Doesn't come with back case and screen protector .... and screen protector is a must for gorilla glass 3 and back case is also required , finger marks come very easily without it.. Final verdict , when your first few min of use is spent with so much issues that u cannot do a simple google log in , your excitement is shattered into frustration, even though the rest of the time there is no issues.....Samsung please wake up!!!",3.0 out of 5 stars
977,Reviewed in India on 28 May 2020,Sajeevan s.,Best phone I had ever seen,"Good phone I had ever seenReviewed on samsung.com. Well, the Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in blue, the first thing I did was put the case that I had already prepared. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to falling asleep playing on my mobile and using it, and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaint with anything about this mobile and 64GB of internal storage, I do not even consider using the microSD slot since 64GB for me is enough, combining it with Google Photos is much more than enough for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars

985,Reviewed in India on 6 September 2020,Arnav Raman,GREAT value!,"I'm writing this review after using the phone for a month, and here's the detailed review of my experience using the phone.. • BEST PARTS. 1) SCREEN: Straight up the most attractive part of the phone. The sAMOLED display is crisp, color accurate and legible even in the hardest of lights. And the Always-On Display is a bliss, with customisable clock faces and even options to place own photos. Since the display is AMOLED, this doesn't cause much battery drain (about 1-2% more drain when keeping it ""Always On"" as compared to off). And the bezels are not noticeable much, and the screen is super smooth. The refresh rate is still 60Hz, but then it's not geared towards gaming. 9/10. 2) BATTERY LIFE: Absolutely unbelievable! The 6000 mAh battery is no joke and it delivers. I use my phone heavily (~10hr screen on time, with video calls, gaming and instagram scrolling) and still the battery lasts me a day and a half. Charging is also good, it takes almost 2.5 hours to get it from ~20% to 100%. 10/10. 3) PERFORMANCE: The 6/64 variant caters to my needs perfectly. There is always more than 2 GB of RAM free, even when there's 4-5 background apps open. Sometimes I minimise my game to respond to a notification, and then forget about it; and when I open it after 6 hours it's still there in the memory. Phenomenal!. The processor, now. Before buying the phone, I read a lot of reviews as I was skeptical about the processor. Snapdragon 730G is better, they said. But to be honest, I really don't see the difference. This phone has never once lagged in my one month of using it. It is snappy and DOESN'T HEAT UP. 10/10. 4) SOFTWARE: As soon as I started up the phone, I opened up the app drawer and removed all the apps that could be removed, and then disabled some I didn't need and couldn't be uninstalled (Samsung's mostly), so that's GREAT. Also, I ensured I disabled notifications whenever any spammy notifications arrived, and within two days my phone was ABSOLUTELY bloat-free.. Samsung's OneUI is beautiful. I have no other words for it. The dark mode goes well with the sAMOLED display, and is absolutely great to work with. I'd always been a fan of stock Android and Pixel, but OneUI changed me. 10/10. 5) CAMERA QUALITY: I'm not an enthusiastic photographer, but as far as day-to-day photography is concerned, it is magnificent and highly detailed. You need to tweak settings in the Camera app to suit your taste and also set the resolution (64MP photos are 3:4 aspect ratio, but I prefer Full screen, for example). I also got GCam installed and that's added benefit, if you care. The wide angle lens is nice! There's barrell distortion at the edges but you get an option to automatically correct it in the settings. Macro camera is able to pick up details easily and really close to the subject.. Front camera is equally good, able to capture details nicely. There's also a wide angle mode for the front camera, though it's just software and there isn't an actual wide angle camera at the front. 9/10 for both!. • NOT-SO-GOOD PARTS. 1) The speaker quality is not breathtaking. It does the job and is reasonably loud, but I prefer headphones or else my Echo Dot for audio, so it doesn't matter.. 2) The back surface is ""glasstic"" and smudges easily. Get yourself a cover and you're good to go.. 3) Fingerprint sensor is FAST but use it once with sweaty fingers and it can't detect anymore unless you clean it.. So, there you have it. If you want a no-nonsense phone with great battery, screen and camera, with NO ads (read: Xiaomi, Realme) and NO bloatware and a BEAUTIFUL UI, look no further. The Galaxy M31 is THE phone to go for.. P.S. call quality and network is also flawless. I use airtel.",5.0 out of 5 stars
986,Reviewed in India on 29 August 2020,Rajendra Gupta,Great phone but leaves much to be desired.,"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage). Pros. 1. Great phone with 128 GB storage and 6 GB RAM at this price. Definitely great value for money.. 2. Total 5 cameras make it a great photography experience. (wide angle + depth + macro for close ups.. 3. 6000 mAh Battery lasts for more than 24 hr with moderate use. Charging is fast. Takes 2 hr to charge from 20 % to 100%.. 4. Switch over to USB type C cable which is going to be the future universal cable across all devices of all companies.. Cons. 1. 128 GB memory is great but within a month it has started getting reduced with software updates. It is the same game that the mobile companies have been playing with the customers. One has to discard the phone while it is still working well because of depleting memory. Let me see how long I am able to use this phone despite my settings to store most of the things in the SD card.. 2. Highest sound volume is also very unsatisfactory. In fact, the worst sound volume among all phones that I have used earlier including three different models of Samsung Galaxy.. 3. The positioning of cameras on margin is problematic because we are used to camera lenses positioned around the mid-line of devices. It is difficult to aim the camera with a side-aligned Macro lens.. 4. Default Font type and size is very small. Option of Samsung Font is provided and it has better readability. But even after switching to Samsung font and increasing the font size through display settings it works on some websites but not on many others where the font remains small.. 5. The phone heats up while charging . I never experienced this heating while charging with any of my earlier Samsung phones... 6. The charger has a USB Type C cable. Therefore, you have to make sure that you carry your new cable with you all the time on the go till it becomes the normal charging cable like the present Type B cables found in each home and office.. 7. Very difficult to take screenshots with M31 because the volume control and the on-off switch are on the same side adjacent to each other.. 8. Samsung has saved some money by not including ear phones in the phone package. Earphone doesn't cost much but a new earphone with a new phone gives good feeling to customers. This was not expected from the cell phone giant like Samsung.",4.0 out of 5 stars

But if you are using social media and play games a lot or surfing internet for a long time then it gives you a decent battery life of 1 day or less.This is not for heavy gamers.Pls keep in my mind the charging time is too long.It charges only 34% in 1 hour.So it surely takes 2 and half hours to charge from 0 to100%.Even though they have given an Adaptive Fast Charger it charges slowly.Due to its heavy battery and 8.9mm thickness I thought it would be bulky but surprisingly it doesn't feel heavy or bulky in hand.Thanks to its curvy finish.. Cellular call quality is good.It has a single Speaker which is loud and audible.Sound through ear phone also really good.. Camera takes decent photos.It has got wide angle and macro too.I have posted some sample shots here .Color Saturation is good.Camera has some more features which I haven't used it yet.Selfie camera is good. When it comes to performance I would say it's not bad at all.I haven't seen any stutter or lag so far.Gaming performance is also good.I am not a fan of PUBG so I haven't installed it.I have Real Racing 2 which played really good without any lag. Some of them has said in their review that the phone has some heating issues but in my experience the phone doesn't heat much while playing games or watching movies or doing any other task.It gets heat while charging but it's normal I think.. In this price range you can get lot of other brands with very good spec.But at the end of the day its SAMSUNG.Due to its brand value the pricing is high for this specs.So finally its user's choice to go for what they wish.. Overall the phone is good in all aspect.",4.0 out of 5 stars

996,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,Amazon Customer,M31 8GB,"Dont get fooled by 8GB ram, it's the processor that matters. a 4GB phone with the right processor will do just fine. Had used samsung J7 pro and Note8 earlier, these were finer phones but again were a lot costlier. Camera is okay, battery is great although it takes lot of your time for charging, so full charge can happen only in the morning after you put it to charge the night before you sleep. Do get a cover when you buy one as it is quite slippery to handle. Blue looks great, Plastic body though feels cheap. I got a 8GB ram M31 using it for about a month now, I feel 4/6 GB ram would have served the purpose just fine. Get 8GB only if you are into serious mobile gaming otherwise it doesn't make sense.",4.0 out of 5 stars
997,Reviewed in India on 28 August 2020,Dr. K. Muruganandan,Samsung M31 from vision impaired accessibility perspective,"with plenty of very good and expert reviews available for Samsung M31 for its deserving features and quality, I would like to share my experience as a user with vision impairment using screen-reader and Text-to-speech:. 1. Samsung mM31 features Samsung's own built-in screen reader 'voice assistant', hence Android Accessibility Suite doesn't come built-in. One needs to download it from playstore if the need be.. 2. Samsung's 'Voice Assistant' is an efficient screen-reader in itself, but those used to Talkback will find it less suitable in terms of gestures and other features.. 3. The camera is surprisingly accessible with the screen-reader telling you if face(s) get focused. I could click not-so-bad pictures as a totally blind person!. 4. Samsung's UI and in-built applications offer smooth and faster navigation while using screen-reader. Most of the buttons in Samsung's apps are labeled and hence accessible.. 5. Attending calls is most convenient with the volume-up button doing the job. Live caption is also another fantastic feature that will be useful for the hearing impaired people.. 6. There could have been an option to wake the Google Assistant using power button since 'Okay Google' comment is not all that convenient in travel and noisy places.. Overall, Samsung M31 is a very good choice in this budget for the visually impaired / blind users too.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1002,Reviewed in India on 29 November 2020,k subrahmanya shetty,Well we liked it so much that 4 in our family are using this phone right now,"There three really amazing things about this phone,. The display, battery and its camera.. For the price range I think this is the best display you would get. Its big, crystal clear and vibrant. The performance is adequate. I'm not a gamer so I dont know about its performancein that area, but on on regular usage this phone rocks.. The camera is lovely and takes really good pictures. Both, the front and rare cameras have been able to deliver really good quality pictures.. The blue glossy finish makes it look very premium. The build quality is excellent.. The best feature on the phone is its battery, I just love it. It lasts for more than a day. I dont have to carry my charger everywhere I go. And can be charged really fast too.. The finger print scanner doesn't work very occasionally but the face recognition comes to its rescue immediately.. The speaker is loud and clear.. All the applications I have on phone right now works smoothly. Never had any lagging issue on the phone.. The connectivity is great.. Overall its an awesome phone. And I can totally understand why Samsung calls it a 'monster'.. I already bought 4 M31 for four of my family members coz even the first one which we bought was still performance brilliantly at the time i ordered 4th one too. So I recommend this phone highly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1003,Reviewed in India on 3 February 2021,Vishal Shukla,Good phone for Daily normal usage but network issue should be solved,"Writing this after 4-5 months of use & first experience with Samsung product (earlier experience was with Redmi Note 4 for 3.5 years). 1. Camera Quality is superb. I don't think any other smartphone in this range can compete with it's quality and build up.. 2. Battery Life is average, kinda expected it be much better since it's claimed to be 6000mAh. But it lasts long for the day so that's fine.. 3. It atleast takes 2.5 hrs to charge from around 10% to nearly 93% even at fast charging.. 4. Fast charging is redundant here. So would recommend to charge it normally or even overnight charging is fine (by disabling fast charging mode). 5. The plastic casing never mattered to me as i used a cover for it.. 6. Faced lot of Network Issue, which is the primary feature of a phone. The same sim at same location works fine in my Redmi but when inserted in Samsung m31 would give slow data speed and other hindrance. Samsung should really work on it.. 7. In Dual Sim mode data speed becomes much worse. 8. After a month use, my phone was unexpectedly hang twice. But after that never faced the issue. 9. Can't comment on Gaming Experience, since I'm not a gaming enthusiast thus never installed one. 10. Impressed a lot by Samsung's Digital Well Being feature, it really helped me to reduce my screen time.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I do not see a lot of properties when trying to restrict no of users for my hot-spot, either I can completly hide it or change password every time I do not want anyone to connect to my hot-spot (previously connected to my phone hotspot).. Rest the phone is nice, it's is not 6.5 I personally like bigger phones but that is repayed by the amazing camera quality.. No heating issues as of now.

1006,Reviewed in India on 27 July 2020,Amandeep Singh Virdi,One of the Best smart phone in 2020.,"I have ordered this mobile on 20/07/2020 and got delivery on time i.e. 24/07/2020. I have chosen M31, 8 Gb RAM version. Earlier I have used Motorola mobiles (which are good and rugged one) and this is my first Samsung mobile and I think I have made a good decision. Rest time will tell in long term use but first impression is great.. So list of Positive points:. 1. Battery is very of good rating 6000 mAh. i do cycle rides using strava which uses GPS continually and to my surprise after using strava app for nearly 5 and half hour which include clicking photos dropped battery level from 100 % to 75% only. Which I think is very genuine.. 2. Processor is fast and efficient with almost no lag.. 3. Camera is definitely a plus point of this mobile. It will not disappoint you.. 4. RAM size is good as per today’s usage and I have opted for 8 Gb RAM so that in future after updates no issue arises. Other wise 6 Gb is also fine if you are going out of budget. (Here I want to mention that I am not a mobile gamer). 5. Super amoled screen by Samsung is just awesome.. 6. User interface is very good with many good options and it will enhance core android experience. You can uninstall or hide default apps that you do not like on your mobile.. 7. Internal Memory is enough i.e. 128 Gb over that you get a dedicated micro SD card slot so that is impressive.. 8. Finger print sensor works very fast and efficiently.. Now coming to negative points from my point of view. 1. Volume of loud speaker is bit less. If finger or something else comes over speaker it reduces volume drastically.. One neutral point is that it comes with a battery charger of 15 watts only which is bit low for 6000 mAh battery but at same time very fast charging is not good for life of battery. May be Samsung engineers did what is best for their product.. Final words ""It’s a good mid range mobile by Samsung with impressive performance”",5.0 out of 5 stars

No compromises there on the humongous 6000 all day long or should I say all 2 days long battery. And the screen is brilliant with popping colours and eligible under sun.. The blacks are deep as it should be on an amoled. Decent gaming is welcome. And the camera is no slouch the quad cam setup comes up with the best of modes. So when you go online with your pictures you don't feel bad at all. Camera has been done rightly. When you can watch Netflix in Full HD there are not a lot of phones providing this option in this segment.,5.0 out of 5 stars
1010,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,Jinu,My best phone purchase until now - Samsung Galaxy M31,I am happy with my purchase of Samsung Galaxy M31. After 2 weeks of using this phone here's my review:. I found this phone is excellent for all round usage. I am purchased Galaxy M31 6 Gb/64 GB space black.. Camera 9/10: Cam quality is very good I would say. When I try to capture low lighting images comes out good but could be have been better. I liked cam features like slo mo and super slo mo using this for first time. 64Mp and 32 Mp back and front camera gives the phone a complete touch the quality of pics is excellent!. Looks 10/10: I loved the looks of the phone. Though the back of phone is not pleasing enough but I am okay with it since I am using a cover. Battery 10/10: it's mega battery indeed. 6000 mah capacity is enough for normal browsing and YouTube vids view for 1 and half day. For gaming 1 day may be.. Display 10/10: i am using amoled screen after long time. View is brilliant compared to others.. Speed and performance 10/10: I am not a gaming freak so for my usage this phone perfectly fits in. I didn't find any lag until now.. Software 10/10: one UI core is very good indeed. Android 10 comes out of the box.. Overall I am fully satisfied with this purchase..

1011,Reviewed in India on 29 July 2020,Harshadkarkera,A good phone at the price,The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good phone with lots of features for the pro. You can actually set your phone the way you want it to be. I have heard a lot of negative comments about the camera but I found it a delight. A little concerned about the battery though it boats of 6000mAH but really doesn't last beyond a day and a half considering the least number of apps that I installed over the existing (not much) bloatware. The phone is really good in terms of speed. I purchased the 8GB RAM + 128B internal memory version which is the best (at the time of my purchase). The screen resolution is good and display is much clear. Great features like dual volte and wifi calling. Altogether a good phone and also non-chinese.

1015,Reviewed in India on 17 October 2020,Akshaya,Value+ for money,"I bought this phone on March 2020, considering samsung brand this is really worth for its price. SAR value for head is 0.338 W/kg where maximum limit is 1.6 W/kg, of course all samsung mobile comes with less SAR value. Other Main attraction is the battery life, with moderate usage battery comes for 2 to 3 days. Camera has lot of features to explore, single shot, selfie with hand gesture, night mode, pro and the list goes on. Camera 📷 lot of AI stuffs were explored. For Smart TV like Sony i was able to mirror the screen, but it failed with iPhone and pixel.. Some scenarios you will be disappointed because of the precaution measures, when phone heat increases certain level apps consuming high memory stopped forcefully, also it some time leads to the unexpected restart of phone (Few scenarios phone got restarted even without much heat). This can be problem when in a critical call. However, Considering the issues faced earlier, I percieve this as additional safety precaution with extra threshold. It will be nice if there is innovation on reducing the heat produced.. For someone who don't overuse and exploit the features, this is good buy. At the end of day price matters and for any brand their premium phone needs differentiator.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1019,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2020,Aditi Nagaraj,A genuine review after a month's usage...,"So I've been using this for a month and honestly, it works as it is advertised. 6000 mah battery lasts for 1-2 days with heavy usage and on full cpu capacity. If you use pover saver mode, it'll last longer. The screen resolution is beautiful. The camera quality is as expected, good. 6gb ram is a blessing for me personally as I used to use a 3gb ram phone before. The fingerprint reader is slow compared to other phones so I gave it 3/5. The reason I gave camera 4/5 is that I can use 64mp only in a particular screen ratio. Hope in the future they change it in future phones. Also you get a pretty blue colour 💙 for the same price along with 3 months prime subscription. If you're wondering what's the difference between a regular version and prime version, it's just that on the home screen when you swipe left, it automatically opens amazon shopping app. This can be disabled but only con is that you can't choose the app. It's amazon shopping or nothing. Wish we had an option but it's prime edition so not complaining again. If you want a good phone with long lasting battery and smooth performance, GO FOR IT..

The software animations are so fluid, the camera is crazy good and the screen is obviously best in the market coz. Its Samsung's. I'm listing some pros and cons down here, be sure to read it. Also I've posted photos shot on this phone for reference.. Pros:. •Samsung's one UI is way better than the competition like Redmi's crappy MIUI.. •The camera's are just too good, the HDR shots are amazing and the 64mp rear and 32mp front camera modes are just the cherry on top.. •6000 mah battery is absolute overkill for a phone at this price.. •The screen is really good, it's Amoled and can get pretty bright outdoors and pretty dim for indoors too.. •The processor is really good too, enough for any task u throw on this.. •Fingerprint scanner is on the back instead of in the screen thus it's faster, more reliable and better.. •Amazon delivered the phone in 24 hrs with exchange so it was amazing.. Cons. :. •No fastcharger in the box even when it supports it, so charging to 100% takes too long.. •In wide angle camera, there's no lens correction like in Samsung's Hughes end phones so photos look weird at the corners(I've uploaded a wide angle photo for reference).. •phone can get a little bit hot while gaming, but not crazy hot so it's fine.. •The 64mp photos are not that crisp so I just stick to normal camera mode.",5.0 out of 5 stars

No matter how pricy the phone is if the OS is clumsy it ruins the experience. After Pixel and Oneplus, Samsung is arguably the best OS. It allow you to get rid of most of unwanted apps, which is not easy in Oppo, Xiaomi or other phones.. PROs:. 1. The display is made of Gorilla Glass v3 and the screen (AMOLED) screen is just awesome.. 2. The OS is much better compared other phones in the same price range.. 3. Decent performance with 6 GB RAM.. CONs:. 1. The processor isn't good for serious gaming. Casual gaming is fine.. 2. The screen tend to heat up a bit after 30 minutes of gameplay. If you are hardcore gamer you have other options with little extra money.. 3. The camera is OK, you might be disappointed if you have used any premium phones before. In this price range not so bad but fails miserably if you compare with phone of double the cost.. 4. Battery drains a bit quick (because of AMOLED screen), the experience is worth it. Go for Samsung M31S if your screen time is over 3 hours a day. For a normal no heavy usage it is just fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1027,Reviewed in India on 22 October 2020,Vikas Jain,"Good features for the price.. but have quality issues battery, Sound and processor","I liked that we can get a 64MP phone with 3 rear cameras and one front camera with good memory for this price. However after over 7 months of use, my battery life has reduced. I cannot run a single day without recharging. The speakers of the phone are the worst. They are so low quality. I got the phone (2 units) for my retired parents. Now not only them, even I struggle to hear thru this phone. Only way to get audible audio is to use headphones. There are a lot of pluses too. The camera is good, really good. We just need to change the default to what size we need. To save memory, the factory setting is at 16MP and not the max 64 MP. So the sharpness and clarity of the pics depends on what we configure in our camera settings. Really awesome camera. The camera features can be made at par with a Samsung note or high-end camera as those are only software updates. Processor is ok, I see the phone getting considerably slow every day after half a day of usage, not the best of processor that i have seen on Samsung Products. I have been Note (multiple generations) user for few years now. The quality of processing speed / Battery / speakers is low .. maybe this is what you get for the price. Overall an ok product.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Worth every penny you spend. 64mp camera is awesome, it really takes some stunning photos. SAmoled screen is crisp and clear. Battery performance for moderate usage for someone like me can work 2days.. I am using Redmi note 7 pro from last 1 year, but this is certainly best in terms of performance as compared to Mi phones.. Finger print reader is also fast. The SAR value of this phone is also very low (0.3) as compared to other high value phones.

1030,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2020,Anand Krishnaswamy,A very good phone at this price point,"Excellent phone with all the necessary specs for a fantastic deal. I bought this at 14999. At that price I needed 4 things:. a) Good processing power and RAM. b) Sufficient internal memory & expansion. c) Good battery. d) Good camera. I'm very happy with the first 2. I have a 128GB card which houses all my data and hence,. 64GB was more than enough for me. Battery doesn't feel like a 6000mAh. My charge runs down to 30% by the end of the day. But this might be because of extensive initial setup. This is why I'd give it less than 5 stars. Another problem is the call-speaker volume is not great.. The camera is mostly good and sufficient for candid photography. The sensor is what matters and it is good enough for this price point.. Some of the built-in features are good.. In short, I'm happy with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The battery life is surprisingly not good. It takes a long time to charge since its 6000 mah battery but drains completely in a day. The face unlock is not that fast. The camera is noisy at night and the wide angle sides gets distorted. Even the front camera is not that good at low light.

Macro lens is not much useful.. 7. Dolby atmos support through audio jack.. 8. No 60fps option in video. Cons:. 1. Plastic body feels cheap. 2. No knox security and secure folder. 3. Exynos 9611 performance is good for basic usage but for heavy usage a big No!! Due to not much powerful processor after some time performance will degrade.. 4.

Fingerprint reader : i'd not the best scanner MI devices are much far better than fingerprint scanner on this device . In 30% cases the device just wont open with my finger whereAs i never had any issues with other devices. Battery : well its good even if you are a gamer it will get you 5-6 hrs of gaming. Never the least dont expect to get good performance i mean the processor on this device is same as its predecessor in 5 min gameplay the device gets so much in the motherboard area , even at 30 fps you can easily feel the temp rising. Weight : its bulky and big and heavy not joking its very bulky and not comfortable with me. So should u buy it ?.

I used 5 days then I came to know that it's hanging too much I return the mobile and got my refund. I thought this happened with that particular mobile so I repurchase the same model in different color. 10 days it was good. Later on it started hanging even I have to rushed up to samsung center for formating. They formated and updated. I came to home after a week again it started the same problems of hanging. I am too much disappointed with this. Although I don't have any games app or any unusable applications. Very limited apps I have in this but still the problems are same.. Battery back is only for 14 to 18 hours if you don't use more.. Camera is like 16 gb no pic clearity.. Charger is for fast charging but it's also average.. Request to other users.

1056,Reviewed in India on 9 October 2020,Vinod V.,Below-Par Quality Battery?,"Bought this few weeks back. Noticed a bulge at the rear near finger print sensor. Had a difficult time to return this since Amazon's return policy for phones is not great even if phone is faulty like this. Considering that phone as such is Ok with decent build quality, a nice screen and decent camera, I would assume Samsung would have cut cost by relying on some cheaper (read bad quality) parts and probably that could be the reason for this. I also find similar complaints on internet of battery bulging for M31 models. Another let down was the screen size. That's not samsung's fault though. All manufacturers claims 6.5 inch screens now. But a phone with 6.2 inch with an aspect ratio of 16:9 is much larger than a phone with 6.5 inch with say, an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Basically, all manufacturers are marketing with 6.5 inch screens whereas in reality these are in effect a near 5.7 inch size. So, if we need big phone, please watch out for aspect ratio, and specifically display/phone width, apart from screen size. (That anyways is not Samsung's fault)",2.0 out of 5 stars

Benefits:-. 1.You will have an awesome call clarity over speaker,headphones, bluetooth or over the ear.. 2.if you are music lover it has multiple play options along with Digital dolby which really make feels of sound ocean(i am using sony MDRzx220BT). 3.Screen resolution is awesome and reading mode is perfect. SAmoled gives you feel of touch.. 4.Battery life is as expected. With continuous music listing and net surfing it will last a day.normal uses 2 days around. It's really monster.. 5. Camera is really awesome and in night mode it's clarity you can see. Super se upper. Wide angel feature is cool and you can cover larger area. You may get upset when:-. 1. During phone update you may fill mobile is getting heated.. 2. S/R ratio is low which is good for your health but if network strength is low you may get call drop.. 3. Front camera is little lagging but through settings you can take perfect selfy.. 4. Till date did not face any other issue.If found will upadte here again..

This mobile comes with preinstall a large number of waste apps. This mobile will show you the notification to update and after updating it will install some unwanted Apps that is very irritating. It will also show you continuously advertisement. Of course, these advertisement and apps from back end is stilling your data and information. The worst part is that some of unwanted gaming and other app you cannot delete, otherwise you may lose your warranty.. I will never suggest a mobile and a company that have their hidden agenda and want to cheat the customer some way or other.. Even though it comes with 4 GB ram, you consider it only 2 GB ram because the remaining 2 GB is reserved for the unwanted Apps and the same with the processor..

1101,Reviewed in India on 17 November 2020,Amazon Customer,Not a worthy phone as hyped.,"This phone is not a good one as being hyped by promoters. I have no star for this phone but I am forced to give one star because I cannot submit the comments without it.. 1. 4G Phone: Technically this phone is not 4G, but nearing LTE. Other LTE phones work better than this one.. 2. 6000mah Battery: If samsung do not provide 6000mah battery, with the exynos 9611 processor, it will not last even for one day. Currently have no apps installed but just two sims and nothing else. Do you know, it only lasts for 35hours only in stand by mode. It is a false promise by Samsung. I thought this is a issue with my phone and contacted the helpdesk, they did few tests from my phone and installed a diagnostic tool and it said all good, so I came to a conclusion that all M31 phones have similar issue.. 2. Camera Quality: Though it has 64MP quad rear camera, i would say it could say the resoulution is not better than a normal 16MP camera. Though it says in the SAMSUNG Portal support site that by default it is 16MP but can be changed. So, in reality, it is only 16MP not better than that.. 3. Processor Performance: There is a lag when we swipe or scroll up or down. Not good. I think, Exynos 9611 can perform only to that extent. Obviously, it is no way near Snapdragan or no better than Helios MediaTek processors.. 4. OS: Samsung customized Android version10 OS. Samsung has made the GUI ugly and not a well planned OS Interface.. 5. Advertisements: People who wish not to be popped up with unecessary Ads and stupid stufs, please dont go for Samsung. I think Realme is much better when compared to OS GUI and ad free Mobile OS.. The only Pro I can think off this phone is its clarity, because it has 409p density. In general, it is not a good deal when compared to REALME 6/7 series phones",1.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung was given the super display at the least price, no other mobile on this will not give this type of display.. Brand at reasonable price.. Smooth functioning..

If you want to check camera features other phones like MI top brands also uses Samsung cameras.. Processer of this mobile was good, it could be designed such a way that it can be operated in lower network area also.. In my area lots of network issues, at that time also this SAMSUNG GALAXY M31 give 6Mbps speed, any other Mobile's of my friends network speed wasn't give more than 300Kbps. Fingerprint reader is also good.. I don't know how many years battery will work, but this is not fast charging, this one is only drawback of this phone.. A separate pouche and glass is required, they won't provide them along with mobile.. Hearpones also not provided along with mobile.. Above mentioned all(headphones, glass and pouch) are not related to product working, they're other things.. I want to tell one thing to Amazon is that. If return amount is small value you could directly return to Amazon pay balance,. But if it is high amount you could deposit it into bank account not to Amazon pay balance. I rised this issue because I am facing problem(rude behavior of Amazon) from last 4months. Because we are students, we're not earning money, if we earn money this is not a problem..

The Camera quality is superb as I have seen till now, the 64 Megapixel camera just excels. The quad camera does it job in a very useful manner, 64 MP main camera has a f1.8 aperture, 5 mp depth camera has a f 2.2 aperture, 5 mp macro camera has f 2.4 aperture and the last one 8 mp 123° Ultrawide camera has f 2.2 aperture. Each camera excells in it's own way, the 5mp camera focuses on the depth ina very keen manner , 5mp macro camera focuses on every object that is too close in a matter of 3-5 cm distance, 8mp 123° Ultrawide camera brilliantly captures all those scenarios which you wish to have it in your phone.. Video quality is so Good that it feels like you are a photo-video maker. The super steady video feature helps in video making, and it will be usefull if you are a vlogger.. Talking about the screen, the 6.4"" inch sAMOLED FHD(Full HD) + infinity U display will give you a attention grabbing feel.. Battery performance is so good that you can use it a whole day! I get a total 21 hours of backup time Including Internet, Music, Video all combined together.. Talking about the processor it just excels in this performance, the 6GB ram 2.3 GHz quadcore processor will help improve gaming experience along with AI game booster.. Charging capacity has been Increased with 15W Fast charging within no time you can charge your phone!.

The camera quality is really nice and after the update I can use manual camera using shutters iso and other features that I get with high end phones. The display quality is really really nice as expected from AMOLED screens. And the battery backup is also nice it can give you have you around 8 hours of screen on time. And after using it for a long time I think that the best thing of this phone is the UI and the one UI is really really useful and very handy. Now let's come to the bad things that I don't like about this phone. And the first thing that comes in mind is the fingerprint reader and it is very horrible fingerprint I don't know the generation of this fingerprint reader if your fingers are a bit of sweat and it will not recognise your finger and I get very angry most of the time(it recognises yourfingers 2/5). Frankly speaking the fingerprint is the worst thing in this phone. The charging speed is a bit of slow but in m31 as it has been improved. Will this is my review of the Samsung Galaxy m31. I have given it a rating of 4 in 5 and 8 out of 10. And I have got the marks in four out of five because of the fingerprint scanner and 8 out of 10 because of fingerprint scanner and the charging speed other than that I am heavy user and I don't use the phone for heavy gaming I think that for daily use it is a very very nice phones and the features of one UI is really nice.,4.0 out of 5 stars
1105,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2020,Ashish Malkar,The best phone at this price range!!,"After using the phone for about 20 days here's my detailed review on Samsung Galaxy M31.. Display - 5 on 5 (Super Amoled Display of 6.4 inch is absolutely stunning. It is really good at this price point). Camera - 4.5 on 5 (Quad Cam setup at the back produces nice daytime images, in nights the images tend to loose a bit of the quality, but that's okay at this price). Battery - 5 on 5 (It's monster battery really lasts long even with heavy usage, It lasts some 2 days for me on a full charge. It takes some 2 and half hours to charge this monster battery, this should have been supported with a 25V fast charger). Body - 3.5 on 5 (Look and feel of the phone is quite premium, though nothing special in it. The glossy back lets the phone down as the back is quite slippery and prone to scratches and finger prints. Must buy a good back cover to protect the phone from slipping from hand). Performance - 4.5 on 5 (The phone is quite good in performance as the UI is very smooth and there are no noticeable lags while using it. I have some 70-80 apps on the phone and the phone runs smoothly. With graphics intense gaming such as Asphalt or NFS No limits phone tends to heat a little bit.). Is it worth buying? Absolutely yes... Given the features at this price point this phone is absolutely worth the every penny.. However if you have a little extra budget, would advice to go for Galaxy M31s.. Thank you,.

1108,Reviewed in India on 24 November 2020,Aditya,REALLY GOOD BUDGET PHONE,"It has been 12 days since I got my phone. The switching from old phone to new phone was super easy with Samsung switch app.. The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive.. The battery life is satisfying. Even when I was gaming slightly (about an hour a day), the battery lasted one whole day. Charging the battery from 15% to 100% takes almost 2 hours. That was a bit disappointing.. Camera is good. The colors come out well. There are many features in the camera - single take, which captures many frames together and makes a movie out it and hyperlapse etc... Image quality is not great. When I zoom into images, the images are grainy. Check the attached image of a leaf.. 128GB storage will be useful since Google is limiting the free storage for original photos.. I have already done drop twice, accidentally and all is well. (The phone has a cheap case though).. The ocean blue color is elegant. I love it... Phone is pretty light for its size. The length is almost 15cm and fills my hand (my hand is 18 cm from base to tip of the longest finger). I find it slightly difficult to handle it with one hand. But, I like the big screen for reading novels.. There are many built-in options that I like - focus mode which temporarily blocks certain apps of your choice from showing notifications and the apps are not accessible by you in that mode. It has helped me reduced my itch to check phone every now and then.. Verdict:. REALLY GOOD BUDGET PHONE.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1110,Reviewed in India on 1 November 2020,Arun NT,Absolutely worthy,"Amazing phone. I was hesitant to go for m31 initially and was looking for m51 due to the snapdragon processor - however I think m31 is doing real good. Incase you are someone who changes a phone once in 2.5 - 3 yrs, I would suggest you pick an 8gb RAM. I see that mostly 5 gb of RAM is consumed and we better be future proof , atleast for a 3 yr horixon. A 9611 processor with 8gb RAM should be abld to handle processing capacity required til 2023. Battery full charge to 10% discharge took 38 hrs twice - including few hrs of video watching, chrome usage, extensive calls in Google Meet and Teams, hours of dealhunt in Amazon and Flipkart etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1111,Reviewed in India on 23 October 2020,Surendra Khandelwal,Basically best in this price range!!,"First of all let me start with why it’s called m31 bcoz it’s Mega than any other same range phones as it has a 6.4 inch sAmoled display which is quite good in this range then talking about the major thing about it which is it’s battery life which is stunning as it goes for like 20 hrs non-stop as I charged it to 100% and used it for the whole day and its commendable as I also bought redmi note 9 pro max with 5020 mAh battery and it ran for 16 hrs from fully charged but it was way heavier than this and also not so easy to carry but then again this phone is quite good to facilitate your daily needs. Talking about the camera, it’s quite good although the night mode can get better but it’s still okay considering such type of product in such low price. The only limitation was the speakers as talking about samsung’s product it could have been better but to cover it up they are providing dolby atmos so it actually makes it up. Now about the game performance, oh it’s superb and quite good and maybe best in such price range as it has its own processor which is quite good I think and it comes in the 6gb and 8gb variant so depending on your needs. Talking about the fingerprint sensors, it’s fast and easy to use as it’s on the back but at day I use face unlock as it’s more handy and also fast. And it’s basically best for binge watching and gaming. All in all, in nutshell, I would say that it’s the best phone currently in such price range so you can buy it for sure.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1113,Reviewed in India on 16 November 2020,Kamal Parmar,Best phone to buy under 18k hands down.. but keep two things in mind!,"Everything about this phone is too good like the sAmoled display and the battery. I'd give 5 stars to everything about this phone EXCEPT:. 1) Audio Output( 3/5 ): We'll, unless you're a musician( like me)or a sound engineer you wouldn't really notice the difference.. but if you listen to music a lot then it'll take a while getting used to this sound.. it isn't bad but it sounds a bit too stereo.. keep that in mind before buying this phone. 2)Camera( 3/5 ): your images will be sharp but when you zoom In, the picture gets all smudgy. Also the ultrawide images have average quality and so does the night mode. But for this price range.. there's nothing more you can expect because I have compared Samsung's camera with realme and Samsung's 48Mp is better than Realme's 64Mp. Overall this is a solid phone but just keep those two things in mind before buying it.. this is the best you can get for this price range.. and the audio and camera aren't bad, but they might not come close to your high expectations.. Also, one thing I wanted to mention is, this is my first Samsung phone and I love it.. the company has a fantastic aftersale support team and you have an app for community of Samsung users where you can share your greivences and discuss stuff with other users and the company itself. I love it! This is the best phone I've had and I couldn't ask for more!",4.0 out of 5 stars
1114,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Amazon Customer,GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHT,Phone built quality is good. It's a very rigid phone. I have already dropped it thrice but thank God phone is working normal till now.. Camera quality is AWESOME. It is best in this price range. But camera is not so quick. Phone gives lag while using camera.. Battery life is normal if we see a 6000 MAh battery. My usage is mostly internet and I use Bluetooth connection also. I get around 8 to 10 hours of battery life when Bluetooth and location is on.. Finger print sensor is working fine. But I think it could be a faster one.. Phone is not so quick while using multiple windows. It gives lag.. Overall I am fully satisfied with the phone performance. Highly recommended if you are searching a new phone in this price range.

1115,Reviewed in India on 28 May 2020,Amazon Customer,"Good for the price, but not for the specifications","Battery life and RAM performance is very good, but the USP - 64MP main camera and other 3 cameras do not perform to the specifications. No portrait mode so no 3D photos on FB. Even the 64MP main camera fails to capture details and objects blur on zooming in - not at all expected. Macro camera does some good work, but not able to capture details required for a macro photo. Wide angle camera and live focus are just good enough. Night mode is not so impressive. Overall, average camera gives average rating for the otherwise good phone.",3.0 out of 5 stars

After 5 months it started randomly restarting when switching apps, which gradually increased to restarting while using any app for long, and eventually could only use it to accept calls. Went to service centre, they said motherboard problem, and said they'd replace the motherboard but not the whole phone, after a few weeks(due to covid) they said cant be repaired and that theyll give vouchers amounting to 15k or so, to use in Samsung stores -_-. Even the samsung store people have told that they have been receiving lots of complaints regarding m31. So, heads up if you're gonna buy.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1117,Reviewed in India on 8 August 2020,Jithesh Nadesan,M31 Best value for money,M31 the best at this price. Best value for money. I was using galaxy note 8. And unfortunately i had to cut down my budget temporarily. So i picked this one just for the time being. Honestly saying i never compromise in quality thats why i always bought too model phones. But this time i am very happy because i did not have to compromise in quality even though i picked this cheaper one. I am not going to through this for bagging the top model. I am satisfied by its performance. I bought this on 25th of May. And its perfectly working so far. I recommend M31 rather than other chinese fancy phones with less price n more futures. There is no comparison for samsung quality. I use samsung' phones since last 9 years.. And like always Amazon is the best in services n deliveries. That is why i am registered with amazon for so many years,5.0 out of 5 stars

Otherwise it's a decent phone at this price. I am not a gamer so can't tell about that.. =======================. Detailed review. CONS. 1. Poor signal reception and call quality in low signal areas.

Cheaper Redmi phones support this.. PROS. 1. Great UI. 2. Frequent and stable updates. 3. Good camera at this price point of 12.4K.. 4. Excellent display. 5. Wifi 5ghz giving great speed. 6. Wifi calling available. Can solve signal issues to some extent if supportedby your carrier.. 7. Average 9hrs SOT on normal usage giving about 1.5 days battery life. 8.

The low light camera is particularly helpful. Front camera is average.. (g) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.. (h) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.. 4.

Battery- optimization of battery is not so good, but yeah you can play pubg continuous for almost 7-8 hrs which is quite impressive.. now you can think of urself how good is its battery. Processor-its processor is quite good, but but but optimization of it is worst, 9611 is quite gud, if it may be optimized well..with the software and games... You can get fps around 35-55 in pubg smooth +extreme. Body-body is made of plastic, and no frame but yaa with a cover it look amazing🖤. Weight- with a massive 6000mah battery weight of the phone is well managed not so heavy, not so light, normal normal but yaa more than normal devices. Last but not the least.

Mainly elders dont use heavy apps or games, if they use it in battery saver mode, it can easily get 2 days of battery life for them.. Note**.

So in short samsung is doing the same things that Chinese brands do. They are no different, don't buy samsung mid rangers. I gave this phone to my mother and she complained me about some 3rd degree apps and notification then I noticed all this. They'll keep pushing you to install the apps they suggest..

For those who are interested here is my opinion... PROS:-. 1. SAMSUNG... A brand which you can trust blindly... Regular updates... Good after sale services... User data security.... Device durability etc... 2.user interface is nice and simple. 3. Samsung's amoled panel is best as usual. 4. 64mp quad camera is best thing we get in this phone..32 mp selfie camera is cherry on top. 5.very quick fingerprint and face unlock. 6.6000mah battery ... Last almost 2 days with decent usage. 7.powerful processor to fulfill our gaming needs... CONS:-. 1. Providing 15w charger is ok but there should have been atleast support of 25w charging. 2.camera saturation level is bit high and its ui can be better...(these can be fixed with updated). 3. At this price level it should also include case or atleast screen protection film. Final opinion:- one can always find cons in anything no matter how good that thing is.. Believe me you will be fond of this phone once you use it,5.0 out of 5 stars

1149,Reviewed in India on 22 June 2020,Vivek Parihar,Decent budget Smartphone,"First of all, this is a china-free smartphone. Samsung produces no smartphone in above mentioned country.. This piece is a value for money product. I am experiencing a monstrous battery life with decent super amoled display.. You will definitively observe a mind boggling viewing experience.. Blue light effect is quite helpful for eyes. And its outstanding camera quality will impress you to the brim.. Last but not least, Brand Value, Samsung always has a reasonable resale value.. Cons:. Speaker output is low. If you are a type of person who doesn't like earphones, and loves to hear songs on speaker, this product might not impress you.. Exynos 9611, though is a decent processor equivalent to Snapdragon 712, but is unsuitable for hardcore gamers. In low graphics, you can observe playable fps.. Charging time is approximately 180-190 minutes from 0-100. Fast charging needs improvement.. Samsung could have provided an earphone, unfortunately, there's none.. Summary:. This is a value for money smartphone which focus is to grab attention of movies and TV show audience. If you go for it, one thing you'll definitely not have is regret.",4.0 out of 5 stars

However, since the price is low many security features in this phone is compromised like Secure Folder, Samsung Pay, Knox etc. Since the price is low Samsung has taken off many of these features which were even available in the earlier J Series.. Performance: Although this phone comes with 6 GB RAM the performance is good as A Series phones which almost comes in the same price.. Camera: Camera quality is also not that good as A Series phones although M31 comes with 64 MP back and 32MP front camera.. Battery: 6000mAh battery will come for one and half day.

1157,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,rejathraj,Best buy for 16k,"I have been using this device for more than 2 weeks. I am an above-average user the battery lasts around 40 hrs plus. I am happy with the device.. 1. About the OLED screen: I can adjust the color saturation, I have reduced the color saturation as I am not that used to vivid OLED displays. Brightness is pretty decent one good feature is that we can reduce the brightness to a lower level such that I don't want to install any 'Dark mode' application for night use.. 2. Camera: Camera is pretty good, the wide-angle view is pretty handy when we don't have much space in the room. The front camera is also pretty decent on low light(Recommended).. 3. Weight: It is pretty heavy as it has a massive 6000mah battery. However, the weight is balanced so it is nice to hold on, we won't feel it too heavy when we hold it for a long time.. 4. Performance: Performance is a said as in the paper, I have tried Call of Duty and worked in medium graphics well.. 5.Bluetooth: Bluetooth is important for me as I usually take calls with my Voyager Wireless headphones. Connection time is extremely low . I could turn on my headphone while phone is ringing and the next second the headphone is connected. I used to wait/need to manually connect on my old Zenfone max. So this is a great value add for me. NB: This is not a dedicated gaming phone.. To conclude with this is a very good phone for people who travel a lot and watch movies , surf internet, attend online meetings during their travel. This is not the phone for gamers",5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought it yesterday in black colour and it feels so great to have this mobile. However, while setting up I faced 2 issues and 1 from a friend. 1- playstore was not updating or installing g new application. 2- YouTube was getting crashed.. 3- A friend of mine who bought this a month back told me that Vodafone and bsnl signals are very weak in this mobile. I fixed the above two issues after watching youtube issues and seems it is very common problem with M31 and can be fixed within 5 minutes. The one my friend faced has no solution as I had the same issue with my airtel number when I had moto g5s plus.. Overall I give this mobile 4 out of 5.

If you are looking for the best camera phone with huge battery back and RAM, then look no further. The 6GB RAM galaxy m31 is the best smartphone in the market which will provide you with amazing features like 64MP primary Camera and a 32MP secondary camera. Want to see pictures ? Go on and check those amazing pictures of the River Brahmaputra, Assam. Stunning, isn't it? Want to go for a tour and record amazing videos ? Do not even worry of battery backup. The 6000 mAh battery in one single charge will be enough for you to click as many pictures a day, record videos and play games as well, forget the battery , it will be enough to last around 24 hours even after heavy use. So go on and order your Galaxy M31. And if you wish to upgrade, look no further than the newly launched galaxy m31s which has many amazing features too just at ₹19.5k.

With day to day usage If you play heavy games like asphalt 9, pub g mobile exsynos 9611 gives awesome performances with game booster I perfectly maintain ram and processor for optimal performance and heating issue too minimal.. Coming to battery life powered by 6000 mAH it gives best performance as of normal usage like social media, surfing taking shot, watching movie and listening to songs battery can last up to 1 and half day easily. When you do heavy gaming like pub g and all in full charge u can play 5,6 hours continuously.. Coming to online streaming and entertainment app like netflix and prime video it supports widevine L1 support as know as HD streaming or you can watch movies, series in high definition.. Now the coming to design it samsung glastic design which feel premium in hands and u water drop notch display with quad camera setup is just awesome..

Touch sensitivity is excellent.. 3. User interface is upto the mark.. 4. Sound quality is average and using earphone/headphone it is excellent.. 5. Charging time is fast with 6000mAh.. Disadvangtages. 1. The most important thing as we know samsung battery backup is never satisfying any user compared to other brand. It does not last a day even if the screen is not continuous light. 2.8 out of 5.. 2. Exynos 9811 (10 nm), the processor is not upto mark as it consumed huge battery which is unexpected. Also, it somtimes delay/hang phone.. 3. One major disadvantage is the signal strength. It is not getting a proper signal while other brand are using full speed on the same place.. 4. Camera is hopeless at low light.. Note: The battery and the signal strength really needs to improved and I hope the battery backup improve with system update.",3.0 out of 5 stars

1166,Reviewed in India on 10 March 2020,Mayank.,Go for it.,"Giving review after Using it for two days. Recieved the phone with 49% charge and it lasted over 7 hours with continuous use. So yes the battery is massive.. Here are some pros, some average features and some cons I experienced in two days of rigorous usage.. Pros-. 1. Superrrrr Battery- Today I charged my phone to 100% and it's been more than 4 hours of continuous use and the battery is still 75%. The Monster battery of 6000mah Is by far the USP of Galaxy M31 and the reason why I bought this smartphone.. 2. The Stunning and beautiful super Amoled Display- OMG I can't emphasize on how gorgeous the display is. After watching on this super amoled screen, every other display of laptop, TV, other phones look out dated.. 3. One UI 2.0 - the UI of M31 is amazing. It is simple yet so satisfying. This is hands down the best UI in any smartphone.. Average features-. 1. Gaming - I'm not a heavy or pro gamer but played pubg and Gareena free fire for a little while for testing. The games do take a little while to open thanks to dated exynos 9611 but there's no significant lag while playing and average players will have no issue playing Games in this smartphone. Not to mention the super amoled screen makes graphics look stunning.. 2. Camera- Both front and back camera in this smartphone are good but not 64mp or 32mp good. However The quality is amazing considering the Samsung brand name and budget price tag. On a positive note HD videos can be made in this smartphone so you can stop taking your DSLR everywhere.. 3. Also has Dolby atmos feature. I did use it while using YT music but found no difference. Maybe it requires better quality headphones to experience or is just useless.. 4. The phone does look good but fails to give premium look. Back panel is plastic instead of glass something redmi note 8 has. However I always use cover so not an issue for me.. 5. 6 GB RAM - the Ram is 6 GB yet only 3 gb is ever free. Rest of the 3 gb is gobbled up by the heavy OS and bloatware.. 6. McAfee antivirus - McAfee antivirus is preloaded but I have annual subscription of Avast ultimate so kind of useless to me.. Cons-. 1. No cover provided within the box.. 2. No headphones provided.. 3. No Samsung secure folder.. 4. Fingerprint scanner is a little bit higher. I'm currently having difficulty getting used to it.. 5. The charging pin Is wider so can't use one charger for all purposes and can't use data cable with other smartphones.. Verdict- My biggest priority while buying a budget smartphone was a Massive battery, premium display, above average Camera, average gaming and samsung brand name. And Galaxy M31 doesn't disappoint at all. It's a well spent money from my side. If your priorities are same as mine then go for it. 👍",3.0 out of 5 stars

Display is good ,video watching experiencing is nice. It gives you dolby atmos sound experience while using earphones so music experience is also good. Certain features are missing which are common inbuilt features in most of the phones like screen recording,notification light,network meter,etc although that can be achieved by installing various apps but it would then eat up your space uncessarily but being a 6/128 variant that wont be much of a issue.

Better sensitivity when compared to Redmi K20 interms of fingerprint or sensors. Better performance overall. No noticeable lag. Photo quality is good. Cons:. Fast charging takes more time than the normal Redmi phones (Around 3 hours). No document mode in Camera - makes it cumbersome to edit snaps. There is no option to turn off Data saving mode alert, even though i don't prefer the phone to show data consumed. Unnecessary notifications from Daily hunt and other galaxy Apps..very annoying (no easy way to switch of these notifications either). Also suddenly camera says ""scan"" instead of working on a click (difficult for Senior citizens). The Samsung headset used also picks up noise while doing recording on Apps like Smule and Star maker - no good DSP and Headset tuning seen like in Redmi or other phones which have adjustments based on headset type. I verified the same headset on multiple phones like Redmi, Vivo etc and it works well there, but picks up noise in Samsung M31",3.0 out of 5 stars

Super Amoled screen is good and the quality is really amazing , it's screen doesn't feel like you are looking at a screen. It feels like it's a picture and your eyes never tired of it like it used to be in LCD screen. The fast charger provided is fast enough and charges at 1% per min. The huge 6000Mah battery is really Monster and last for 2 days for a normal user. I'm really happy to buy such an amazing phone..

Its completely Bloatware Free. (If you Dont accept samsung Ad Policy). and i didn't find any issue with google play download. Ther is samsung AR feature also in camera. And you can also split Screen (old). Pop app feature (great). Camera has built in document and qr scanner. What if samsung launch this phone with 90 or 120 hz display and with 7000mah battery and knox security thats a real Beast!!. For now M31s is in my wish list. Which has bigger screen that you'll not notice and don't care either. Camera is same from outside and there is major upgrade from inside (image sensor Sony ). And Software (one shot )*flagship phone feature .... It'll be really good when they will upgrade Processor ...why are you(Samsung) continuing same processor in Whole M Series...

Camera quality isnt as we can say 64 mp but the wide angle it creates and captures is awesome. Selfie camera is thumbs up.. Baterry life was the primary thing i went for and in this range this battery pickup is great.. The touchscreen, smooth touch, sleek and classy look is more than the price.. No heating problem, no hanging problem, bit of network connectivity problem probably due to the operator.. I would have given 4 straightaway. But .5 is to be added for the low price range and .5 is to be cut for the not so 64 camera quality. So i go with 4.5*",5.0 out of 5 stars

Fingure reader is faster in camparision to face unlock. 128GB storage is also more than enough.. Problem with it is its operating system compared to 5 year old mi prime 3s phone it seems little dumb.. Eg. 1) Face unlock needs you swipe to return to your previous screen.. 2) Tapping on date / time do not take you to calender or clock setting. 3) If you turned on flash light pressing power button twice it should turn off. 4) QR camera given by default on notification bar is never works like QR code scanner it is normal camera or it is confusing.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1216,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,Shyam kumar,Total review of M31,"The Samsung Galaxy M series has gained a lot of popularity thanks to affordable prices and up-to-date hardware. Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment. Samsung has now launched a successor to the Galaxy M30s, called the Galaxy M31. You now get a quad-camera setup, an upgrade from the triple camera setup on the M30s. However, the processor and the battery capacity remain unchanged. Will this be enough to keep the Galaxy M series competitive in the market? We review the Galaxy M31 to find out.. At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin, but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.. Pick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.. When you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.. The Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Pros:. # Rear camera photo quality is good and customizable to choose if we need 64 megapixels or less to save space. There are different modes and filters which is very good.. # Video mode has slow, super slow and hyperlapse modes as well which makes video capturing fun. # Front camera is good if there is proper lighting. Dark places or shots are average.. # Battery life is good and lasts 2 days with standard net usage and calling. But I have only few apps installed for now. Will check the battery performance as more apps gets installed. # mobile processor is good and fast but note that I use the mobile for normal usage (net browsing and calling) so not sure about performance of playing high graphic games.. # Finger print, face recognition features are good and responsive. # with 6 gb ram and 128 gb storage, this leaves ample space to load up apps and store photos or videos. There is also an expandable memory slot.. Cons:. # The Sim and memory card tray is very thin and delicate so care needs to be taken while removing and inserting. A bit sturdy and strong quality tray should make this fear go away.. # Flashlight is average. My previous J7 phone had a more powerful led flashlight. # Battery gets hot when the AR mode is used in camera. Since this is an inbuilt app, it cannot be uninstalled.. # Charging is not super fast and takes about 2 hrs for a full charge. Charging cable is a bit short.. # No headphones provided but this can be brought separately.. Verdict: In this price range of Rs. 15000-16000 this is a very good phone and I am completely happy with the decision and would recommend to go for it. Samsung is a reputed brand and I have always preferred this brand for its good quality products.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1222,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2020,Raghuvansh Kumar Singh,"Massive Battery, Awesome Camera , Decent design, Best Smartphone under 20k, 6 Gb ram for Games.","Mid-Range Beast. I had bought a Samsung M31 for me. I use it daily for a while and wanted to share my thoughts regarding the smartphone. The most appealing part of the phone is its massive 6000 mAh battery and its camera. Still, by having such a huge 6000mAh the weight balance is well maintained. Even if you do heavy gaming on this phone, the battery doesn’t drain out easily. The main highlight of this phone is not only its battery but also the 64mp camera. The camera provides many different modes like wide-angle mode, macro lens mode, etc which enhances the photographs. The 64mp camera inflates the quality of photographs to capture your unique moments. The rear-facing camera performed great. The front-facing 32mp camera is perfect to capture every detail of yourself. Both of the camera performance is good. The Beast M31 is powered by its own processor called Exynos 911 processor. I didn’t experience any lag or shutter while playing games or any application. The device has 6 GB RAM which enables multitasking more smoothly. The device has only a single speaker at the bottom but I think the speaker could be more slightly louder cause if we put our finger over it the sound mutes completely. Now talking about the design, I have a space black variant with the headphone jack, primary and secondary microphone and USB type C port, and fingerprint sensor on its back. The design is impressive and decent but I think that the built quality could be better as it has a polycarbonate back. The Display of 6.4-inch Infinity U display with Super AMOLED display protected with Gorilla Glass 3 which makes the phone smooth to use and protected with new display features. The Galaxy M31 is a good option if your looking for a phone under 20, 000 rs, and trust me that Galaxy M31 will not disappoint you. A great smartphone at a budget price.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1223,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2021,Tejas Bendre,Dont buy. Worst phone experience of my life,"I purchased this phone thinking about it's long battery life. When I used my phone for the first time, my battery drain was faster than my previous phone. Even on standby, I was losing 2% - 4% battery roughly every 30 mins. This was happening even when I reduced my brightness, turned of my WiFi and Mobile Data and revoked the ""background data usage' permission from most of my app.. As this was already not enough pain, I realized the top left side of my fingerprint sensor had gone inside the plastic case. It is not a big dent, just 1mm - 2mm. This happens only because of the plastic case which bends a bit. You'll notice it only if you touch the sensor on top left corner.. I then spoke to customer care and after 1 day, a replacement handset was issued. I experienced the same battery drain issues with the 2nd handset but the fingerprint sensor was slightly less dented (It was a bit but can be negligible).. I again had to go through the entire process of charging my phone to 100%, then using it and draining my battery till 0%. Then recharge to 100% and sending my battery consumption data to amazon customer care. However in the end I got my money back and am now I have been using POCO X3 since 3 months.. Only organization worth a good review is amazon. They helped me to get my money back and did not say that ""I made a bad buying decision so I will have to bear its consequences."". Thank you amazon for helping me out.. PS - POCO X3 has been working well however its a bit heavy, actually very heavy compared to other phones. Now I have gotten used to holding a heavy phone but I don't recommend POCO X3 either. There are other good phones in the same price range.. Think carefully before buying this samsung phone. For me it was only a pain in my ass. Ciao",1.0 out of 5 stars

1228,Reviewed in India on 12 June 2020,SURAJ KUMAR,SUPER PHONE UNDER 20000,"OCEAN BLUE, 6+128. The product was delivered to me on 8th March 2020,so i am reviewing it after 3 months.. 1. Camera Quality. The quad camera is awesome, even some shots can be compared from cinematic shots you can zoom the pic upto extreme extend.. Front camera is 32MP and selfies are as good as the pics taken from rear camera Sometimes even better.. Overall camera is excellent .. 2. DISPLAY. With the phone equipped with superamoled along with infinity display you can watch some videos on YouTube even on 240p and it gives the feel of 360p quality.. Needless to say about HD video their views are crystal clear.. Although the display is protected by Coring Gorilla 3 but i would suggest the buyers to apply screengaurd the quality of videos or the touchscreen functions would not be affected i can assure you for that.. 3. BATTERY LIFE. The most demanding feature in any cellphone.. For normal usage like movies, calls, videos calls, music the battery would lasts upto almost 2days.. On the otherhand if you are a heavy gamer like PUBG or CALL OF DUTY, then also you can play these games 8-10hours continuously.. I have played PUBG on M31 8 hours continuously with 15% battery remaining afterwards.. 4. GAMEPLAY. PUBG never lags. Whenever i am playing with my squad they say the game is lagging as some squad or any enemy is approaching but i never ever experienced any type of lagging during gameplay except the network error problem or sometimes when internet is not working properly.. Otherwise, if you are a pro player of PUBG you can reach CONQUERER rank with this phone.. 5. RAM & ROM. The buyer will get almost 110gb of user space as their some pre-installed and system apps.. With 6gb RAM you are all set for smooth and fast gameplay and multifunction.. 6. FINGERPRINT READER. You can add more than one fingerprint.. Beside that the sensor is at the back side so at times you can feel that the sensor should have been on screen otherwise the sensor responds quickly to the fingerprint.. Overall it's best phone in the market below 20000.. The only missing quality was 8gb ram according to my opinion but on 29th May 2020 8gb RAM variant was also been launched.. The one and only drawback with this cellphone is its charging time as the battery capacity is 6000mAh but the charger is of 15W only so it takes 3hours to charge the battery 100%.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1229,Reviewed in India on 2 December 2020,Manjunath Bawkar,Impressive enough for me👌,"Reviewing the product after 4 months of delivery... the phone is awesome. The fingerprint reader doesn't recognize my fingerprints sometimes idk why is that so. Battery life is not as long as mentioned in the details of the product. I mean, yes it can work for 48 hours after charging it fully, but only with average use. One cannot enjoy 48 hours of hardcore gaming. I, despite of being a teen, have discontinued hardcore gaming since like a month and my phone works absolutely fine for like 36 hours once fully charged, which is quite impressive for me. Also the phone gets heated a few times, but it happens mostly when I use it while charging, which is acceptable 😅. The positives outnumbered the negatives nevertheless.... The display is awesome, camera quality is quite impressive, so is the ultra wide angle feature and so many other photography and videography options in it. The device is pretty elegant. In a nutshell, if you are a working man or woman or a teen like me who's not into hardcore gaming, this phone is a considerable non-Chinese alternative for you. But if you're not, then you can look for better non-Chinese alternatives like Asus (which is Taiwanese), Apple, Motorola and Google (which are American), Panasonic (which is Japanese if I'm not wrong🤔), LG and Sony (which are South Korean) or maybe our very Indian Micromax which may and should bring it's own gaming devices very soon😍",4.0 out of 5 stars
1230,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Kaushal564,*Beast of the Segment*,"*Looks_Premium*. Samsung has gone with glasstic for the back of the phone — plastic that looks and feels like glass — which is smart, because it gives the phone a premium finish while keeping the weight low. And weight could have been a problem given that Samsung shoved a monster 6,000 mAh battery into this thing.. And don't let the ""glass"" in “glasstic” fool you, it’s still plastic and still prone to scratches, and it’s glossy, making the phone slippery to hold, especially for someone as butterfingered as I am. On the bright side, the phone doesn’t look cheap, unlike its predecessor.. Battery Life- An Absolute Beast. Packing a whopping 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M31 has managed to reach roughly the end of two days on a single charge, despite being connected to Wi-Fi for the majority of that time, with Bluetooth on and multiple wearables and a pair of wireless earbuds connected for good measure. That’s on top of the heavy use activities I mentioned previously. Simply put, you’d have to be a serious procrastinator to even think about draining the battery completely in a single day.. Samsung Galaxy M31 – 4. The Galaxy M31 proves that having a multi-day battery life doesn’t cost the Earth, and if you were planning on using the M31 as your main media device of choice, this unbelievable battery life paired with the phone’s AMOLED screen makes for a match-made in heaven. You could binge content for hours on this thing.. The only letdown is the supposed inclusion of 15w fast charging, which I beg to differ. When hooked up to a power outlet, it took just over two hours to reach full charge from 8%. If charging your phone overnight is part of your routine then you’ll never have an issue here, but needing a quick top up before you leave your home is just out of the question.. Camera Quality- Good but not Best. Good quad rear camera setup - 64MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensor. Shots taken with the primary camera during daylight are quite satisfactory, images are detailed, especially the 64MP shots, and they showcase good dynamic range. The ultra-wide sensor, like on any budget phone, is a good addition - it takes social media-worthy images in great lighting conditions (in low-light, the quality dips and pictures look grainy and noisy, wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges). Photos taken in low-light looks good - switching to Night mode helps reduce grain in the output and further improves image quality. Live Focus shots are quite impeccable and the camera app does give you the option to set the level of blur before taking a shot - edge detection is very good and the Galaxy M31 does a good job of separating the subject from the background. The macro camera takes decent shots outdoors (though, the quality dips when indoors and the output is restricted to 5MP in resolution). The 32MP selfie camera is quite good and takes detailed selfies (though, in low light, the quality goes down a notch and results are grainy). Overall, the cameras on the M31 are good for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title crowned to the POCO X2). Overall Verdict:. Samsung's Galaxy M31 delivers the promise of long-lasting battery life and one of the best in its class in the market. In the camera department too has improved a lot over the predecessor.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1232,Reviewed in India on 3 September 2020,Joel Jayakar,My best friend ever.!,"On the day, the mobile was released I couldn't hold my excitement and ordered this Monster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything else from this except battery life. I needed a smartphone with bigger battery that lasts longer than usual so that I can do everything that I want to.. Talking about the battery life, it works as promised. On Wifi, I used continuously on Day 1, and it took 21hrs to drain from 100% to 0%. And I tested on mobile data the next day, it took around 15hrs to drain completely. Im super impressed with the battery life that I will blindly get a smartphone from Samsung if it has a big battery.. Fingerprint reader and Face recognition are pretty fast. I was never expecting this speed at all. Camera quality is really good. I always had doubts in mind about cameras in Samsung, but this one cleared off everything. I feel proud to have this when I see the pictures on other handsets.. Many people have misconceptions and complain about the processor in Samsung mobiles. Actually, it all depends on your usage. Processors in Samsung handsets aren't outdated, they deliver pretty good performance. I never had any such problem.. The mobile is not lightweight like other mobiles. But, a 6000mah smartphone of today will definitely have this much weight. I hope the design will change in future to have a lightweight smartphone with bigger battery.. Finally, I want to conclude that if you want a phone that targets Productivity, M series is best. And M31 is the King of this segment.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Been using this as my primary and only phone for around 6 months now. So far so good. I'll keep this short and to the point:. Pros:. 1- smooth operation most of the time.. 2- camera is really good. Good modes, good clarity. Sizable upgrade from my old moto g5s plus.. 3- screen is good. No complaints.. 4- audio quality is good but could have been better. 5- battery is a genuine masterpiece. Lasts close to 2 days with very heavy usage and that's good enough for me.. 6- pleased that this is manufactured in India. Cons:. 1- occasional stutters. I don't know why but occasional app transitions stutter and it can get annoying. It's not very common but say I swap between WhatsApp and Reddit while typing something, there is a noticeable stutter. Hope this gets fixed. Update: it has reduced but it is still noticeable. 2- fingerprint sensor could use some speed enhancements. 3- facial recognition is in my opinion it's downside. I don't use it much but it is very sloppy and inconsistent.. 4- NO IP RATING. I'm surprised that I overlooked this at the time of purchase, but this is a genuine let down. I can handle my phone well, but this can definitely screw with your usual usage if you are a rough user.. All in all, phone does my daily activities well and I don't have too many complaints, but I'd have liked it if they fixed the stuttering and had added an IP rating.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1234,Reviewed in India on 24 October 2020,Amazon Customer,Good Budget Smartphone,"Samsung M31 is an average phone in terms of feature pack. 'One step ahead and two steps back' Samsung seems to be in terms of delivering features. Camera is stunning. Sound is good. Jio sim works better in low network areas. Absence of Samsung pay or pay mini, music player and FM player is disappointing. Massive RAM and battery life justify the price of 15k Unlike Xiaomi, Vivo or other brands, still feeling obsessed with the phone after the use of a week.. Finger print reader has some lags.

1239,Reviewed in India on 9 June 2020,Divyanshu Gupta,Best Non Chinese Tag Phone under 20K,"Writing this review after using this phone approx 26 days... So there will be complete review about this... Why i brought this:-. Because i want to switch more safer android smartphone, market of samsung is less than others cheap prices tag company phones but in Android nothing is more safer than samsung.. because there security patch is better in terms of all... Also i need better UI, i was earlier using MIUI, & want to use new Ui specially with flagships tag phones... In world people prefer Apple than samsung... In India we brought what we saw is cheaper or just processors.. What they ""भाई इसमे snapdragon hai"" just snapdragon doesn't makes ur phone good or best... Samsung has world class infrastructure to provide the best thing to u not just anything without prior experience.... So heres few things i like most... 1. Super Amoled Display: its having suoer amoled display which is way better than anyone in this budget.. as samsung super amoled consider as best due to high ppi.. which makes every dot if colors very good... Suitable for netflix, prime, video watchers .. 2. Battery: it has 6000 mah battery which is highest in this budget segment with 15W fast charging, took almost 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%. But belive me if its charge 100% use continuously till evening, and still u have 20-30% left... PS: normal use, not games... 3. Quad camera: it has quad camera 64-8-5-5 which is also not available in this budget segment in any others... Same configuration... Plys sasmung has better image processing softwares and good sensors... Hence the camera quality is also good... I had attach pics too... 64 mp main camera, 8mp wide angle, 5 mp macro camera, 5mp depth camera.. 32 mp front camera... With 64MP Ultra-High Resolution ISOCELL also Bright GW1 image sensor. .. Slow mo with super slowmo which is way better, live focus, night mode is excellent... 4K recording from front as well as primary camera. All these are good.... 4. Exyons 9611: it has Exyons 9611 which is better than many processor, it runs PUBG as well as many heavy games at HDR quality without any frame rate down, not even lags... So good one.. yes its not better than snapdragon but yes it works better till now i found nothing negative from processor... 5. Audio: it has one good quality of speakers and very loud... It comes with Dolby atmos hence using external source of speakers from this phone is way better... ... Best phone in under 20K segment, i brought this in 17K 6-128Gb configuration... If u want this for just only Gaming than dont prefer this, if u want daily use mobile with less gaming, and high usage of videos, social sites surfing etc than its best one... .. What i was thinking to get more. 1. Gorila glass 5 for screen instead of 3. 2. Face lock little bit faster (although no use of face lock bcoz maximum prefer finger lock). 3. Liquid cooling technology if possible (bcoz if u play pubg for more than hours in full settings it will heat little bit but not as Xiomi phones did). 4. Want some more colors.. only royal blue & black with plastic body.. still it looks bettee. I m using black one... 5. Atleast add Case in mobile box, only charger provided.... I hope i added the valid points... ... PS:- it is made in India, and has no links with China bcoz samsung has world largest factory in Noida where these phones were made, not assembled.. most of the parts were manufactured in India, only super amoled screen shipped from South Korea and few other parts from various countries... As all company's did.. but has no link with china.. for more google it",5.0 out of 5 stars

After using for some time, I put it on charge at 10% battery and after 3 hours it was just 54%, even after 9 hours of continuous charging, it could only charge upto 74%. Also, the mobile data doesn't work after some time. We need to switch off the SIM and then ON it for further usage. I am really disappointed with Samsung. Now there is no option of returning the phone and all my money is now wasted. This policy of Amazon just proves to be a big problem for genuine buyers..

Still some reality check is necessary, so that I am writing this review after using M31 for 45 days of use.. I bought it as an alternative to Chinese brands but feels lag on several departments.. 1.In fingerprint reader, you will not be able to notice it when ur mobile get opened by touching fingerprint sensor, in note 5 pro vibration with fingerprint sensor touch was there to make it easier.. 2. Even with 4000mAh battery note 5 pro was working whole day well and no battery drain problem was at all.. Now with 6000mAh battery I get also whole day battery backup and little more than note 5 pro. In M31 I fell battery drain problem of almost 10%,when I woke up in the morning.. 3. Camara quality is more better in M31 than note 5 pro, but you have to also mind that note 5 pro was launched 2year before . And even at that time it was providing excellent camera quality.. 4. Touch screen with S-amoled in M31 is excellent.. 5. Non availability of front flash while in note 5 pro it was.. 6. In spite of fast charging option, the 15W charger provided with pack of it is not enough to charge it fast, you have to buy another high capacity charger.. 7. Loudspeaker has less volume compare to note 5 pro.. 8. Blue light emit more comparable to note 5 pro. I always use it in filter mode.. 9. Price wise it is good, got M31 with 6+128 in 17 k compare to 4+64 in 15k of Redmi note 5 pro.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The price is quite affordable and the performance has been really good. The fingerprint scanner was comfortable to use while holding the phone.. The 6000mAh battery definitely gives a long lasting performance and it's really impressive. With the 15W charger provides a quick charging time, with the battery life lasting for nearly a day.. The camera quality is quite good although not the very best but at this price range, it's definitely worth it. I particularly found the quick detection and focussing of the 64MP rear camera quite helpful while capturing the pictures in daylight.. The wide angle lens do give you good pictures though they could be slightly distorted at the edges. The 5MP macro camera is also quite decent and captures really good images in the daylight.. Potrait shots were good and the camera app gives you the option to blur the picture to your desired level. I found the 32MP selfie camera to be very good. Overall pretty much satisfied with the camera performance.. Software performance and UI are top notch. Although the design of the phone is good, the heavy battery adds to weight. This can be a slightly good thing as the phone might not slip easily out of hand.. I bought the Ocean Blue version of the phone and it looks very nice to see as well as use.

1247,Reviewed in India on 6 November 2020,Arjun Kailash,Best Battery life and Camera for reasonable pricing,"Pros. Battery life. Camera. Performance. Cons. Fingerprint reader. Sound Quality. Fast Charging. After using the J Series (have used J7, J7 prime and J7 Pro) I came back to Samsung for the M Series and this M31 is superb👌. They have really worked on some issues they had earlier with their budget phones and that is why in M series we get the best battery life compared to other phones in the same price range and specs. Nextly rear cam is Quad which includes 64MP and Front cam is 32 MP, what more can you ask for than this. Coming to camera quality, in J series and few other budget phones the photos taken in low light were below average but now the photos are very clear but still there can be improvements in night vision.. The two cons I felt are Sound quality and fingerprint sensor. Sound quality like before is only average in loud speaker even at full sound we feel the volume is low amd fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't detect or takes time to open which is irritating at times. And the major con I felt is fast charging, its a 15W Fast charging but takes long time to get fully charged, its understood as its backed with 6000mah battery so by default you could have gone for 25W instead of 15W. Apart from that the overall performance of the phone is really good.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1250,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Shankar,Samsung  M31,": It takes an extraordinary effort to grab some eyeballs for a Samsung smartphone, if it does not belong to the 'S' or 'Note' family - a feat achieved by Galaxy M30 and M30s last year. The M series was launched as an online-exclusive to compete against Chinese makers like Vivo, Realme and Xiaomi. The most recent smartphone launched under it is the Galaxy M31 which succeeds last year's Galaxy M30s. The latter was one of the best mid-range smartphones of 2019, offering a massive 6000 mAh battery, a feature you also get on the M31.. While the new smartphone borrows most of the features from its sibling, it does get some upgrades too, including an extra camera at the back. Samsung hasn't increased the price much with the base model of the Galaxy M31 priced at Rs 14,999 and this itself should attract a few buyers.: It takes an extraordinary effort to grab some eyeballs for a Samsung smartphone, if it does not belong to the 'S' or 'Note' family - a feat achieved by Galaxy M30 and M30s last year.

1252,Reviewed in India on 27 May 2020,Manooj,Worth for the price,"I was previously using moto g5s plus and this was selected after comparing many models in this price range. Using this for the past 4 days. Everything is fine, the clarity, sound, network, net speed, gaming. Heard many negative reviews for the processor used. But comparatively no drawbacks. You can definitely go for this model. And to mention, the SAR value is also very very less in the price range.. Camera clarity is good and very good voice clarity of calls..

At the price point this is killer. I was about to buy IQOO but then the announcement of M31 was too tempting to resist. At 16k, 6000 mAh battery with 6GB RAM is a stealer. The battery life is indeed monstrous. The phone is very responsive.

1255,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2020,Happy,Alright for the Price. Disappointed with Battery!,6 MONTH REVIEW:. I came to this phone after using the S7 for 3 years and finally decided to move on to a bigger screen and also the battery on the S7 had seriously degraded to a point where I had to recharge it twice a day.. So one of my major draw for this phone was the 6000 mAh battery sadly that was the most disappointing part of the phone. The phone was advertised as having a 2 day battery but with my primary usage of watching videos it hardly lasts an entire day.. It does last 2 days on light usage though which comes handy when traveling.. I have disabled fast charging to allow my battery to last longer but even in cable charging mode the phone charges quite fast which is good.. It also used to hang and restart abruptly quite often initially but after multiple updates it seems to have stabilized.. The fingerprint reader requires multiple tries to work as it seems to attract smudges which inhibit it's performance.. The Camera was one of the prime reasons to buy the phone and it's perhaps the best feature of this device. I usually use the 64mp feature for highest quality which it delivers.. Overall for the price the phone is alright but hopefully Samsung can improve the battery life through some future updates.,4.0 out of 5 stars
1256,Reviewed in India on 22 October 2020,Sai Uddhav,Samsung M31 review,"Almost a month. Got it delivered on 29th Sep 2020. 2 main features the camera 64mp and battery 600mah is a false representation by Samsung. Battery life- no doubt its a fast charging battery, equally fast, is the drain of battery.. it is surely not a 6000mah, feels more like 3000mah..... Camera - front end camera is good. Rear camera feels more like a 16MP or less.No ways its a 64MP. Completely unacceptable from Samsung for projecting a wrong spec.... The phone got automatically switched off while browsing through files Not sure why it happened....( this issue still exists reediting this portion after 6 months of use). Phone feels light and no lags as of today.. Sound quality is good(speaker). Nice display, so many unwanted apps pre installed, thank God deletable.. Call hearing quality is good at both ends.... Overall the fact of buying the phone for good camera and battery life a huge disappointment",3.0 out of 5 stars

1260,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,Kinnari kelshikar,Best mobile in affordable price,"The battery life of this product is best so far even with heavy usage and gaming the battery stays for more than a day. Camera quality is amazing. It's not very heavy and has a sleek design. Samsung has kept its focus on the cameras as the Galaxy M31 touts a 64MP quad camera setup. Other key Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications include a Super AMOLED display, 6,000mAh battery and Android 10 software. The front of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is familiar as well, as you're greeted by a 6.4-inch full HD+ (2,340 x 1,080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display, much like its predecessors. The display gets a U-shaped notch up top that houses a selfie camera and a fairly thick chin.. Thanks to a glossy rear panel, the Galaxy M31 is a fingerprint and smudge magnet, something which is quite noticeable on the black colour variant that we received for review. Moreover, the rear panel attracts scratches if you place it on a table or in your pocket along with some keys.. This mobile is the best in affordable range",5.0 out of 5 stars

Similar backup in my previous vivo with 3400 mah battery.. 3) camera 64MP but similar quality pics compared to other 48MP pics of vivo and realme.. Except above, the phone is nice and good option if you don't want to purchase Chinese brands as in my case.. 4) very long charging time more than 2.5 hrs.

Neutral :. 1) Battery is ok but not looks like 6000mh.. 2) Processor is ok but not for gaming.. Cons :. now, there is an infinite list of cons and this is the reason for zero stars.. 1) A spy phone which installs apps without user knowledge.. 2) No option to disable the Galaxy store and appcloud. daily 400MB data goes to spam apps like mxtakatak, CRED, BYJU's, Chingari, Josh, etc which gets installed automatically without the user's knowledge.. 3) what the hell to Samsung's marketing strategy, Samsung lost the ethics. I tried all the options to change the config to avoid any spam app installing but couldn't work.. 4) Camera is like a VGA camera in the 2005 era. my Moto G 1st version camera was far better than this..

Battery life also fell short of expectations considering it's huge with 6000 mAh.. 3. There seems to be some minor heating issue as well, nothing to be concerned about but still annoying.. 4. Speaker is too loud and not properly sound proofed. In fact, if not careful others can easily hear your phone conversations.. 5. Finger print sensor is also not that great.. 6. Software lacks few basic things such as internet speed meter, limiting number of hotspot connections or blocking a connection, an easier way to create screenshots or turn off the screen. For that, you will have to enable assistance menu which is not that convenient. All these features and few more come in very handy based on my earlier experience being an MIUI(Redmi) user..

1292,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2020,Shailesh Mewada,"Display, Camera & Performance",After purchasing this device I'm writing my opinion for Samsung Galaxy m31. Screen resolution absolutely stunning at first sight you will fall in love with it. About system presentation Samsung have really worked great on it to make it much better compared to its previous devices available in the market.. Camera performance is some what not as per the expectations compared to the other devices with 64 mega pix.camera available in the market. Performance of the camera in low light is not that much good.. Last but not the least regarding performance guys I'm still thinking after creating such a beautiful device why samsung have kept 1 lacuna i.e. processor chip set. Other brands are providing Snapdragon chip set which is much more powerful at this price segments while Samsung is lacking that which is some what found disappointing w.r.t. the performance. My recommended for samsung is to have Snapdragon chip set so that it will make a complete device.. So guys if performance does not matters for you Just go for this device this is absolute beauti from a Samsung.,3.0 out of 5 stars
1293,Reviewed in India on 22 February 2021,Amazon Customer,Very much unsatisfied with the phone.,"Hi,. I bought a Samsung M31 on 21 September 2020 and from past 5 days I have been experiencing a spreading pink purple screen problem, we have taken it to the service center today morning and to our surprise they say its not covered under warranty. They are trying to convey their opinion saying its because of pressure on the screen which is utterly nonsense to me as i don't carry my phone in pockets and always keep it safe. And I strongly remember there is no case of dropping the phone as well, It all started with a small pink spot at the corner and slowly spreading like an ink all over the screen. I strongly deny your service centers perception of this problem and to be honest they haven't checked it for even a minute and asked to pay around 6000 rupees towards replacing the screen which is quite weird when its under warranty.",1.0 out of 5 stars
1294,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Amazon Customer,What a long distance runner,"A good phone if not better ,at this price from Samsung which is Made in India . I have ordered this mobile online after reading the reviews but I am slightly disappointed with the performance . I'm writing after 3 weeks of usage, andmy experience with m31 has been topsy turvy. However, I am impressed with the long lasting battery, andslightly disapointed with speed of the processor. Eventhough , RAM is 6GB.. Good:. - comes with Android 10. looks great.. - Display is excellent with Blue light filter.. - Performance is good. Experienced slight heating issues and also found lagging.. - 6000 Mah battery is good enough and is lasting 2 days for me with moderate usage. So, happy with it, but takes about 2 hours or more to fully charge the battery. - 128 GB storage is pretty good for regular storage and no need of further ROM.. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE. - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 20 percent charge. But, Charging took in excess of 2 hours. - Mobile speakers sound is ok, but not as loud as , other budget phones of this price range. This is a big let down for me.. - Camera is good. Macro performance is very good - daytime pics are good but night photos are a bit worrisome. A big letdown in this price range, vis a vis , other competitors. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. So, no need to carry a professional camera, as the day light pics are as good as a pro.. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good, if not better.. - Received after two months of ordering, due to lock down of covid19. Not So Good:. - bulky, but ok.. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex. Feedback. - A bit slippery in hand, dropped twice but lucky recovered without any damage. No screen guard or gorilla glass. Already, find some scratches after two weeks of continuous usage. Could have been supplied with gorilla glass this price.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1299,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Sukalyan Maji,Best Mid Range Smartphone ever by Samsung,"This phone has mainly 3 main objective:. Monster battery, camera and display.. I will give review in details about this phone.. Battery: with approximately 2hrs of gaming time and 7hrs of screen time battery life took almost 30-33hrs to come from 100% to 5-15%. As well as it took almost 4-4.5 hrs to fully charge from 5% to 100%.. Camera Quality: I have attached few picture samples from ultra wide angle to macro to 64MP shot to 32MP selfie shot. The camera Quality is excellent but if Samsung could add the single take feature by some software update, this phone could be unbeatable at this price segment.. Fingerprint reader: it's very responsive and took micro second to respond. It's face unlock feature is also great responsive.. Processor: exynos processor is good but can't handle heavy game, expecting Snapdragon chipset later in this range as well as I really want ardeno GPU than this Mali, but due to having 6gb ram and 128gb storage phone didn't lag at all but I personally need the change in GPU at least.. Speaker volume is average. Best advantage is having 3.5mm headphone jack port.. Having 3 in 1 slot i.e. 2 nano SIM and 1 dedicated micro SD card slot.. Back panel is very fingerprint catcher, but using a case can solve this issue.. And that's all from my review, feel free to rate my review high and can ask me any queries related to this smartphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1300,Reviewed in India on 16 June 2020,Vaibhav Bachkaiya,The usual Samsung/Exynos Lag!,"Riding high on Anti-Sino wave, a lot of my friends purchased Samsung products over the Snappier snapdragon containing Redmi/realme phones. I gave into the ""wisdom of the crowd"" and got my mother one. Man, the story hasn't changed a bit for Galaxy phones in India. The Exynos used to be better than the SD till 810/815 - but the mid level snapdragon rangers (720/730g) are leagues above the Exynos 96xx.. The performance of the phone is laggy. The battery despite being humongous 6000mAH, doesn't really last as long as you'd expect in comparison to a 5020mAH of Redmi note 9 Pro/max. The fast charging in relative terms is really slow (2-2.5 hours 5% to 100%).. The Camera is decent, the UI is good, the build quality is good. But what really disappoints you is the non-snappiness of the phone. If you compare the poco x2/RN9Pro max and M31 side by side - the phone feels like a low tier middle ranger or one running on a dated mediaTek processor! The overall experience - really hits the rockbottom when after a game, phone takes a 2-3 second pause to repopulate the screen icons.. Samsung, please give the Indian market the choice to select between the two processors for your phones.",3.0 out of 5 stars

But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product. Defects:. No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:. -headphone audioJack not working. -caller audio receiver not working. -speaker not working. Videos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2× speed.. Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.. LIKES:. Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and camera.. Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression created.. WHO can Buy:. -Camera is priority. -Wants some bigger battery. -day to day regular usage. -Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.. For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wisely. PHONE WONT' SATISFY:. -Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.. -onscreen finger print sensor-A51. Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.. For this price,this is a real mega monster.. REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.. Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.. Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer's😁",5.0 out of 5 stars
1302,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Manish Kumar,A decent deal at this price range.,"Well I would like to share my honest review after using it for more than a month. Below are some pros and cons of m31. 1.Battery life is very decent. Last for one day with heavy usage, 1½ day with moderate usage and 2 days with light usage. 2. Performance is also great. But Snapdragon would have been better as this phone will disappoint you if u play pubg and other high graphics game. If you only use some basic apps for office work or you are a student and use study apps, then absolutely no issue with performance.. 3. Due to a larger mah battery, it is somewhat heavy, yet bearable.. 4. Camera quality is decent in day light, with focus mode and video recording is also good, but is disappoints in night light.. 5. OS is also good, with less ads and high security (one of the perks of being a Samsung mobile user). 6. And at last, Super Amoled screen is awrsome, with vivid colours and natural outcast. If you like videos and movies, then you are gonna like it too.. Conclusion: overall it is a great product. I would give it 9 points out of 10.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The battery also lasts long if you are not a gamer, if you play games then the battery might die out faster than usual but overall it has a good battery backup and also takes charge very fast. The camery quality is ok, there are many features available which i am not good at. Those who are interested in all these stuff s will have an advantage but there is one problem that the photos are yellow toned, even the pink walls look like yellow in it.

I feel it is very user friendly smartphone which offers high quality sound, amazing camera quality. In a full charge, It's able to use it throughout a day( even though the internet is on). All the sensors( including finger print) are working well..... I always go with Samsung bcoz I have been using my Samsung E7 since 2014. I'm happy to say you that it's still working perfectly alright... you can trust Samsung phones..... My experience changed, dears..... I regret on the previous positive review I made. Today realized Samsung provides the worst customer care service.... the so called 1 year warranty assured by Samsung is only blowing in the wind.... Let me come to the point.. I purchased Samsung M31 in June 2020. Last day I found a dark shade on the bottom corner of my mobile...It hasn't even a single scratch or line on it...It is within the warranty period... I visited Samsung service center and conveyed my issue. But they are simply arguing that it is external damage. How can it be external damage without a scratch or line on it? they didn't give a satisfactory response. Then I called the helpline number and talked to them...They also made me disappointed arguing the same...I asked to forward my call to higher authority. Then also I didn't get a favorable reply. They are saying I have to change the display, out side warranty, on my own risk. Then, why service centers?. Now understand my choice to buy Samsung phone was wrong.... hopefully, this will be my last Samsung phone....",1.0 out of 5 stars

I faced the same issue with an earlier purchase too (even with the replaced phone- i returned one phone because of the camera tilt issue - but the replaced one also had the same issue).

I think currently my phones battery only has 60% of it's initial capacity as battery draining has almost doubled even if you do nothing. If you just leave the phone overnight without any background app open, it drains 5-8% battery in just 8 hours. Which is quite disappointing. Though good product in budget.. 1st review(3month use): I would suggest buying this to other customers as till now, it's been 3 months I have this phone, and I'm using this phone for gaming purpose each and everyday for at least 3hours per day, but still battery survives for around 48 hours. So no doubt battery is really good. But day by day it's getting weaker I think. While playing PUBG Mobile default settings, battery drains faster than other games and app.. I have no complaints on display.. Camera is not as good as expected from a 64MP primary camera, but that Slow Motion and other camera features are good and enjoyable.. Processor is OKAY for me, as I do use HD graphics and High framerate by default in PUBG Mobile, and it runs smooth. I'm not going to higher those graphics as I'm no professional gamer and and graphics looks smooth for me.. For simple use and for free time gamers like me, think this phone is perfect.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1326,Reviewed in India on 14 October 2020,Hari Shankar,"Felt in love with the UI, display and privacy protected. Amazed","RAM, Gaming etc are all good as compared to other Chinese competitors. Insuch a low price.. You can have a Gaming phone in sams price range with a bit higher performance but you cannot beat samsung in these top favourite features which this phone has.. 1. The class of design and display 5/5 stars. 2. The UI is the best i would say it can not be rated because it has surpassed the barriers of star rating as no device matches this even in high end phones.. 3. Most important. The privacy and data safety features like samsung max and device care outsmarts every non samsung phone.. If your want to use something which you can feel classy in your hand, mesmerizing to the eyes.. The display is like even on the lower quality video you gets the so vibrant display.. You instantly fall in love with it.. It is and it will always be hard for any company to replace Samsung. Samsung is Class Sung. Best thing about this phone",5.0 out of 5 stars
1327,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,Vinay Indoria,Great buy at the price point!,"The camera a above decent, it gets nice picture when given proper light. Took videos as well bt for slow motion videos u need natural light, the camera app won't trigger slow motion under low light. Having said that, the pictures are too good given the price range.. Coming to battery! U can easily stretch 2 days wid average use, even with battery below 20 percent u can easily game for 1-2 hrs (personal exp). Its a beast when it comes to battery, the only con is the amount of time it takes to charge.. The fingerprint reader acts fast bt due to flat nature with the back of tge phone it gets difficult to locate, if ur using a case then no problems. But wid no case u have to locate fingerprint reader, a slight curve wud have been great!. Rest I have been using the phone for more than 1 month and d phone fell for more that 7 times bt till now the front screen is intact. There are scratches on the back bt build quality in terms of front glass is awesome.. I would suggest any1 to buy!",5.0 out of 5 stars

1334,Reviewed in India on 27 May 2020,Ravishankar Iyer,Initial impressions and basic user review of Samsung M31,"I bought the black 6GB/128GB variant a week ago and have been using this phone ever since. I'm happy with its performance in general, so far.. Few things which I feel require a quick mention:. 1. Battery - Although the phone has a fast charging capability, my device takes roughly between 1.5 to 2.5 hours to completely charge, which is a bit disappointing, but the battery lasts easily for 24 hours so that's okay. Still disappointed about the slow charging bit.. 2. Camera - The primary camera performs best in an outdoor lighting condition with a fairly decent color reproduction. The EIS for 1080p videos is good. The front-faced camera captures good pictures and records video decently in indoor lighting conditions. Didn't get to check it in an outdoor condition.. 3. Other features - The build quality looks premium. The volume and the power buttons appears to be of good quality. The finger print sensor has a quick response time which is great. The touchscreen quality is indeed good. The OS operates well, I haven't noticed any lag so far. The dark mode is a welcome addition to this phone. Call quality is very good. The speakers are fairly loud given there's only 1 speaker grill at the bottom.. Overall, in my opinion M31 is a value for money phone from Samsung.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1336,Reviewed in India on 2 September 2020,S. Vinay Kumar,Mixed experience,"The Samsung pH M31 has its share of pros and cons. I am writing this review aft using the ph for 2 weeks.. Pros - no doubt good battery life one full charge and u can easily be on a zoom video call for like 6 hrs and der would still be decent amt of charge left. The camera is decent. Sound output is decent. Call quality is good. pH is also sturdy.. Cons - thanks to the 6000mah battery, the phone feels damn heavy in comparison to my old 1+ 5 ph. You might get fed up of the weight. The charger says fast charge but once the battery is down to 15 or 19 percent, to get the ph fully charged you will need atleast 2.5 hrs to 3 hrs. Can you seriously spare so much time for that. Samsung could have provided with a higher amps charger. You won't be getting any ear phones in the box, so you will have to invest on a ear phone again or use your old one. At times there is a lag of a sec or so while using the ph.. I am thinking of changing this ph asap mainly because of the weight.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I don't found any miss match between the claims made by the company and actual functioning of the phone. I have seen some reviews about poor quality camera but that is not correct. Actually, default setting of the camera is set 16mp to save your internal storage. If you want 64mp quality, you change your settings.. As far as performance is concerned, it works fine as I aspects with 6gb ram.. Screen quality is too good as compared to any Chinese phone or budget phone in the market.. Colour are very natural, give great experience in watching movies and photos.. Fingerprint reader respons well and very quickly.. I am not very familiar to use face scanner, so I can't comment about that. But I used it twice and it worked perfectly.. Battery life of the phone is good.

Whatever my friends tell me or show off I simply prefer to stick with Samsung.. Finally I settled for Galaxy M31 with 8 GB RAM and 64 GB internal. One big headache in buying a new phone is getting your data and apps in the new phone. It was a was a joy to see that everything from J7 Pro came to M31 with a press of a button. The display is much better. I am happy with the battery life as I don't have to recharge it every day.. Compared to other phones, ""the Accidental touch Protection"" really works in M31.

1359,Reviewed in India on 22 October 2020,Mahima Ann Saji,Fantastic Product,"The Samsung Galaxy M31 has borrowed its design from its predecessor -- the Galaxy M30. At first glance, it is quite difficult to differentiate between the two devices. The smartphone comes with a 6.4-inch Infinity U display surround by not-so-thin bezels on all sides. The smartphone features smooth edges and round corners, which makes it comfortable to hold the device. Apart from the large display, the front also houses a 32MP selfie camera. The right side houses the volume rockers and power button and the left is home to the SIM card tray and microSD card slot. The mono speaker, USB Type-C charging port and 3.5mm audio jack are located on the bottom of the device. The Samsung Galaxy M31 comes with a shiny rear panel which attracts a lot of fingerprints. The back panel consists of the quad-camera setup, fingering sensor and Samsung branding. The smartphone does not fail to impress in the design segment.

1362,Reviewed in India on 1 June 2020,Sreshtha Mondal,Why you should buy the #MegaMonster,"I got the delivery of the phone 2 days after its launch, so this review covers my experience of about 3 months-. 1. Screen - The Display is superb to say the least. sAMOLED display makes watching videos a delight!. 2. Camera - Few modes and video shooting in both rear and front camera is great. The enhancements dont make the photos look artificial which is great! However, can improve on the 64 MP mode - probably on OTA update can fix it.. 3. Battery - I have used phones with 5000 mAH battery for the last 2-3 years from Asus (Max series) - If I would rank that 5/5 because they would easily last 1.5 days without charge, this would be 4 +0.5 /5 ( 0.5 for fast charging, even if battery drains out fast). A full charge can last the day. This is when I have medium to heavy usage of phone without gaming.. 4. Processing - Very smooth for 6GB, no lags whatsover!. 5. Some modes and features -. •Dolby Atmos Sound mode for headsets is amazing!. • Game mode has lots of features related to screen like screen recording, etc.. • Fingerprint scanner is super fast too. Haven't tried the face unlock so can't comment on that.. Overall, would suggest that if you want to couple the brand trust along with good features - definitely go for M31 !",4.0 out of 5 stars
1363,Reviewed in India on 29 November 2020,Mahmad Kapasi,Good Features but Average Performance,"So, I'm writing this review after using this mobile for 20+ days. Here's my experience with this Phone:. 1. Look wise mobile is good and pretty attractive when it comes to features.. 2. Camera quality is very good, as what company claims about 64MP back quad camera and 32MP front facing camera. Shot a video of 2 sec, which gives us the clear quality.. 3. Now comes to the feature parts, company claims 6000mah battery but performance is quite poor. Once fully charged, battery only lasts 24 hrs or less.. 4. Fingerprint sensor is not good as it should, takes a quite time to read the prints.. 5. For gaming mode, it still hang a bit. But with this processor and 6GB RAM, we can expect much more.. 6. Bluetooth is the worst part of this phone, get in loop mode of continuous connect/disconnect within close distance.. Overall, It is an average phone based on my experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars

The phone never really hangs and its always smooth, thanks to 6GB RAM. DISADVANTAGES:. 1.

Samsung has truly given us a gift with the M31 model.. The monster battery of 6000 MaH is definitely the higight, but apart from the amazing battery we need to take out time to appreciate how beautifully Samsung has balanced the weight of this huge battery in this handy phone without it being bulky. It is truly crazy!. I have been using this phone for a little over a week now, and I am just in love with everything it has to offer.. The camera quality is just amazing, people just need to make sure that they set the default output of the pics at 64 Mp as the phone naturally clicks pics at 16 Mp mode to save space.. I love that my phone is add free (which is such a relief!) And all the other features are just so fun to use!. This phone is seriously a SNATCH at the price Samsung has introduced it.

1376,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Srimon,An killer monster device for a medium high user(not gamer),"Almost perfect for regular usage for a normal non tech guy. The battery is quite great, runs for whole day (i charge up the phone at night).. Let make some pro and cons about it.. Firstly pros-. 1. The monster battery. It really a good one when comes to battery life. It will gice u juice for whole day for a medium to light heavy users.. 2. The design. Some people finds the design very cheap. But for me it is quite great. The black is very dark and sexy. However the back panel material could have been improved.. 3. The Display. My god this display is killer one compared to any display in this price range. But ofcourse u have to sacrifice the brightness for such great quality s-amoled display. Colors and tones are perfect for media users, so smooth to watch. My eyes never get tired.. 4. The UI . The samsung UI is new to me. I was a MI user for last 5 years. I have to say one UI is quite clean compared to MIUI (full of Ads).. 5. The camera. Most people says its a killer camera setup. In daylight or medium light, yes this is killer camera. Colors balance, overall tones, exposure maintenance are very satisfying. Front camera is also good to go.. Now coming to the long waited CONS.. 1. The Performance. Dude if u are a heavy or medium gamer, this is not good choice for u. It wl decrease the Cpu performance when get overheated during 30min up gameplay. Thermal throttle is normal for this device.. 2. camera. In night or low light, this device looks like VGA camera, utterly crap. 64mp camera dont have zoom. EIS video have super low quality. Slow and super slow mo are meh meh (average type). Front camera video also not upto the mark.. 3. Back panel. The back panel material feels so cheap. It can get scratches within 1 week if u dont use back covers.. 4. The Notch. At this price range and time (mid 2020) we expect atleast a puch hole. The drop notch is not upto the mark.. 5. No notification light is gonna make ur life hell. U have to wake the device up to see if u have some important notification.. 6. The face unlock. My gos this is the worst face unlock among all. Never seen such slow device when comes to face unlock. Though the fingerprint unlock is quite faster.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The 5 camers(4 rear and 1 front) are awesome the quilty is quite good even in low light, the video have a option of stabilization which give great stabilization even if you shake your phone but at the same time decrease the quality. The UHD mode gives you 4k recording.. The display is so bright and vivid, the display shows you good color, the black are more black and white are more whiter.

I also have a galasxy M20 at home and in comparison the fingerprint scanner is a thousand times better in it. The fingerprint scanner in this device is slow and it sometimes doesn't even recognise my fingerprint. While unlocking it sometimes straightaway shows the message that please put the password we cant recognize the fingerprint. Registering a diffrent fingerprint didnt help at all and sometimes some apps stop working too for instance google chrome isnt working since the past week and i cant even delete and re install the app. Over all fingerprint scanner is the only big issue. I keep the fingerprint scanner clean and dry at all times even my finger.

1388,Reviewed in India on 14 August 2020,Arunabha,Excellent phone at the price range,"I am writing this review after using the phone for a week.. I had very clear expectations and idea about what I want and till now I am extremely happy that this phone has ticked all the boxes. I am a heavy user with about three hours talk time, another two hours using the phone as my tab, checking mails and working on other apps. Besides this I listen to music and an episode of a web series and checking faebook. All these put together, the battery lasted for more than one and half day. Moreover, even with a 6000 mAh battery, this phone looks surprisingly small and light.. Next comes the display which is Samsung's forte and it is stunning aa ever. The black is black and the colours are brilliant.. Camera is quite good. I recorded a dance performance of about 5 minutes which has come out very well with all details. However, low light performance is not the best. Overall, camera performance will get a very good from me.. Navigation is easy though I like stock android more.. However, this is not the fastest phone. Exinose 9611 is an old processor and even with 8GB ram ( I have two M 31) the speed of multitasking is moderate. But, that is sufficient for me since I am not a heavy gamer. And at this price range, I think it gives more than enough.. However, one thing of this phone which is really annoying is the length of the charger chord. I have not come across such a short chord in any phone. It is barely 2 ft and you have to keep the phone very close to the charging point which at many times is not possible and hence becomes a real challenge. Overall, I am very satisfied till now. My last phone was Nokia 7 plus and this NEW is definitely scores over that by a good length. In fact, this better than Redmi Note 9 which is driven by SD720.. A great value for money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1389,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Kaushik Chakraborty,Truely a mega monster,"Samsung has made a significant improvements in its low budges smartphones thanks to the healthy competition by all other counterpart smartphone makers. I have been using the phone for almost 2 months now, it is going absolutely fine. The most eye catching element in that phone is its 6.4 inches SAMOLED infinity U display which enables you to watch high resolution videos and movies a genuine pleasure. The details, colour generation and the vibrancy of the colours are truely soothing to eyes. Apart from that it comes with Samsung EXYNOS octacore processor accompanied with a 6 GB DDR4 ram which does a decent job, for normal user it works absolutely fine and if you are into high end games then it might not be the best option. In addition , it has a moster battery capability with 6000mah battery it covers the entire day pretty smoothly eventhough it has been used quite rigorously, that inclues browsing internet heavily, watching 1080p videos on youtube, talking throuh video calls so on and so forth. It also supports dual 4g sim simultaneously that means you can use 2 4g sims with LTE option on at the sam time. Cameras are also does a decent job, which comes with 64 Mega Pixels primary camera along with 3 other cameras for depth and other functionality, its front camera is of 32 Mega Pixels which performs pretty nicely. There are few drawbacks in that phone and they are its back is made of plastic which could have been replaced by metallic materials and looks of the phone could have been beautified 10 times of it has been given. Another cons I would say its camera inspite of having 64 megapixels in low light its performance drops a little. That's is all about the phone .

Please suggest what should be done?. Updated review post SW recovery :- stars updated from 3 to 4.. The samsung team responded well and recovery of my dead phone was made possible.

1394,Reviewed in India on 15 August 2020,NISHA SANTHOSH,The MONSTROUS M31,"My review comes after a 15 day use with the M31.. The features offered by this phone at this range is really astonishing.. Let it be the monstrous 6000mAh battery or the clean One UI or the Processor.. I was a bit confused at first with the Processor as I felt Snapdragon offered by other manufacturers had an upper hand over the Exynos, but I am clearly mistaken as the performance of Exynos is on par with a 7 series Snapdragon (Exynos might even be better than Snapdragon).. I have not faced any kinds of issues with high end gaming or continous usage.. The next big thing about this phone is the Battery, the 6000mAh battery is actually the real deal.. Under heavy usage I have got a battery backup of nearly 18hours.. Even with the monstrous battery the phone is lightweight and easy to carry.. Samsung has offered decent 64mp quad back camera which also houses an 8mp wide camera and a 32 mp front camera.. In my personal opinion the M31 camera stands ahead when compared with its competitor Motorola Fusion.. The fingerprint sensors are backmounted instead of inscreen unlike the new normal.. The backmounted fingerprint sensor seems to be faster than the inscreen fingerprint sensors provided on the Samsung A70 smartphone.. But at times I have faced issues with slow detection on my M31.. Disregarding this small problem the M31 is the perfect budget phone currently in the market.. I as a customer of Samsung highly recommend you to purchase this mobile phone..

I ordered the Product on 7th Sep 2020, It was Delivered by 10th Sep 2020. As soon I received the Phone delivery, within couple of hours I had recognized that there is some problem with Phone Camera.... Thu, Sep 10 2020, 7:41 PM (Delivery Day) : I had registered my complain on my Amazon Account, also tried to Connect with Customer service on Call, The guy advised me the Factory Reset Option, I followed his instruction but it didn’t worked. Fri, Sep 11 2020, 2:30 PM : Next Day I again called the Customer Service, she instructed me to install some service app on the ordered mobile, Since I was not carrying the new mobile with me so I tried to call next day. Sat, Sep 12 2020, 9:40 AM : I Called the amazon Service, The Guy told me that he needs to check the actual cause of problem, for this I need to install some app on my new mobile so that it can scan and find the problem, so he instructed me to install “minspect” app, this app failed to recognise the fault, then he told me to download “Blancco” app, I don’t know whether it worked or not but after few minutes he told me that he is arranging Technician visit, the Technician will come and inspect the Phone, Available Tech visit Slot was on 15 th Sep 2020 after 2PM, I found myself comfortable with available Slot so the visit was Scheduled, I was supposed to get an email one day before the Tech Visit with Contact details of Technician, But I didn’t get any confirmation by Mail or over Phone…. Tue, Sep 15 2020, 2:50 PM : No details, No Calls No SMS and No Tech Visit - When I called the Amazon Service He apologised for the Best Service of Amazon, He arranged the Next Visit on 17 th Sep 2020, I requested him an E-Mail Confirmation about the Scheduled Visit, but he refused to confirmed by mail (System me koi problem hai sir), and noted my registered number with a promise that he will call me on 17 th sep 2020 by 5 PM to enquire about my complain!!! He also promised me (On Record) that If Second Tech Visit is also not happened then Product will be returned since it is the Policy of Amazon that they never go for Third Tech Visit.. Today 5:26 PM (17 Sep 2020) : No Tech Visit, No Repair, No Return – Today when I called the Support, It was really surprising to know that No Tech Visit Was scheduled, She told me that since I have not received any confirmation by mail so there was no such visit was scheduled, But when I argued that Amazon Service guys had confirmed me Two Visits on Record, She told me that no such Visits found on Record… any complain will not be registered unless a Technician inspects the Phone, So I am not left with any option but to rely on Amazon Support, She Registered my Request for Next Tech Visit.. Product can be returned by 18 Sep 2020, and Next Tech Visit is on 19 Sep 2020 (confirmed by Mail and by SMS)!!!….. I just want the Problem with Devise has to be addressed. Amazon Service Team has ruined all my hopes, I am Still carrying the Faulty Product SAMSUNG M31 , 64 GB, 128 GB with 64 Mega Pixel Camera (Which is not Working). I had spent about Rs. 17,500/-, my energy to get connect with Service Team 5 to 6 times and Tons of Mental harassment,.

1403,Reviewed in India on 20 October 2020,Amazon Customer,Bad customer care service from Amazon,There is heat up issue with the battery. I tried to charge the phone and it’s heating up like hell. I raised 3 complain for exchange and every time they want to do trouble shoot and telling me upload a app to clean some data but I have no data as I just charge the phone and started facing the heat up issue and I don’t want to take risk what if the battery explode but they are not ready to do the return instead they are saying it’s us who will decide whether your phone is eligible for return or not. This is first time am facing an issue with Amazon. I think people are trying to put Amazon down that is one of the reason they are making their customer unhappy. Since when customer is not allowed to take a decision for his own product. If I have placed a return after few days I can understand but I revived the phone at morning and from afternoon I wanted to return as I know no trouble shoot will resolve this issue,1.0 out of 5 stars

I must say It's a best budget smartphone and moreover its and Indian smartphone which is made in india as well as manufactured in india so this phone can become the priority for those who wants to buy only an Indian smartphone.. Talking about the camera,The 64MP rear camera capture the perfect picture as you want to capture and the detail are so accurate , macro lens is also great to access and one can enjoy it if they love to capture nature scenery with closeup. The video stabilization is very well and performance is excellent moreover there is a inbuilt AR ( Augmented reality) creation system which give you and creative mindset to draw any feature along with recording live. The Screen response is very fast and you can travel from app to app with ease. Screen display is very well protected with 3 layer of gorilla glass and the picture quality is outstanding. Its processor is one of the best processor to play high graphic game like PUBG, Fortnite , Free Fire , Call Of Duty etc. Gamers will love this smartphone. Speaker are very loud and accurate and one of the feature named as 'DOLBY ATMOS' give you out of the space music experience because it make the music in 4D type I mean the music seem to be roaming behind us from left to right which give an extraordinary experience for music Lover. Coming toward the feature , I have never seen this type of AI ( Artificial intelligence) features in other smartphones, the pop-up view, AR Drawing pad, Bixby vision, Smart Switch, Dark mode etc. Battery life is very long and it comes with 6000mAh battery along with 15W charger and charging cable is of good quality. The fingerprint reader is accurate and very useful feature because it also help you to fall down the notification pannel which is and effortless feature.. I am Loving this Smartphone.

Didn't expect this kind of quality from samsung and who is monster in galaxy series more than 12 years. To avoid Chinese model, I have selected this model.This is 1st time I am writing review, usually not. Because of not satisfied.. - Camera quality is utter worst. Once you start capturing to stabilize it will take 10-15 sec. Image quality not good. Video also pixalid.. - Battery life is not more than 1 day with full charge and moderate use. Eventhough it has 6000.. - Many pre installed apps. ( All amzon apps,Chat, Netflix). - Touch response is average.. - Important one, no navigation touch buttons (back button,middle&right).

1411,Reviewed in India on 8 June 2021,Pradeep,Awesome mobile...,"- I bought this mobile 2 weeks ago and got the mobile delivered the next day itself and thanks to Amazon.. - Trust me guys, I'm very impressed with its performance and battery pack up is superb and it lasted for me more than a day after even after watching a movie in Prime and googling all social media. Screen resolution is very impressive and it also has the option to record 4K video but I haven't tried yet.. - If you want to experience Dolby Atmos, then this is the perfect mobile under 15k and I enjoyed the music effect with a unbranded earphone and I guess the effect would be more good if we go for branded Headphones. Also we can feel the Dolby Atmos in full only in wired headphones and not with a Bluetooth headset completely.. - Selfie camera with 32 mp is really good and very useful for video calling.. - Only thing I am disappointed is it does not have a Screen recorder app and also the third party app doesn't record the internal audio as it records only the video. Samsung should look into this feature asap and give an option to upgrade so that we can download the Screen recorder.. - Samsung customer care is not very supportive as they simply say that someone will call from their back end team but you will receive any call from them.. - I feel Samsung should have given more option while recording the video to add more Contrast, Brightness, Saturation etc so that the video looks rich like real 4K video.. - Super Study option is of no use as it adds more grains in the video and it is better to shoot in normal mode.. Overall a very good mobile for this price with amazing features.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1414,Reviewed in India on 15 December 2020,Amazon Customer,Worth... except few compromises that can be fixed by Software updates ONLY IF samsung wish to.,"After using 1 & half month.... Battery life is good as its 6000 mah, but a real fast charger (30 watts or more)should have been supported..as it takes about 2.5 hours to full charge from 10 percent using inbox 15 watt charger.. Camera is good in day light but worst performance in artificial light, dont go with the numbers as 64mpixels also tha macro camera is with fixed focal length so you will have to adjust distance to get a clear shot.. It comes with one UI core version so keep that in mind, it doesnt have safe folder or knox security.. It comes with dolby atmos sound and I love it. Its just amazing. Speaker sound volume and quality is also good.. Display, Super amoled, great experience.. One bug I found very annoying, I listen songs when I ride bike and I use 3.5 mm jack wired headphone, When listening a song and if a whatsapp message comes then the notification ring tones keeps on playing with the song I listening, even when I read the message and then close whatsapp, still ringing, I then closed music app (gaana app in my case) still notification ringtone is going on, I then muted the phone..but still going on, then disconnected the headphone jack, it started playing in speaker now, The only option to mute it, is to restart the phone. Its very very irritating as I have to stop bike take the phone out and restart it every time. I think its a software bug, dont know if its gaana app or the operating system of the phone, Samsun, please check this.. Else everything is Good.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1415,Reviewed in India on 14 October 2020,Ambily,Nice Midranger for this Discounted price,"Good Midranger smartphone. Iam giving this review after a week of usage.. About the Performance :. Mine was 6gb so smoothness was fine for me but the processor could be better because this could not even win against Snapdragon 660 in the geek bench scores. But overall good. About Camera :. 64MP taking good photos.. Colours were vibrant. But the without the HDR function all the photos looked over exposed especially the sunlight. After the one ui 2.1 update we could not set HDR manually.. The main drawback of 64MP is lack of details. But it manages to take good ones. Comparing to Sony 64MP Sensor the Samsung is very much lacking in Details and HDR function never works in 64MP mode.. Normal Video Recording is strictly restricted to 30 FPS. We could not even change it using other camera apps.. Slow motion (240FPS) is having some freezes randomly.. Super slowmotion is working fine (480FPS) and recording only 1 sec but excellent.. Front Camera is just fine, cannot say its good because it also lacks very much details.. About the Battery :. Battery is very good.. But comparing to 5000mah phones, its performing same as these phones.. sAMOLED will consume more battery if white light is produced. So we could ignore the difference between 5000 and 6000.. About Display and UI :. AMOLED has its own drawbacks and some pros. Ui is clean and smooth.. Amazon done their job correctly 👏. Delivery was perfect in this Covid 19 pandemic",4.0 out of 5 stars
1416,Reviewed in India on 24 November 2020,A Genuine Tech User,Value for Money >16k INR,"Samsung! A trusted brand. Candid review from a first time Samsung user.. Likes:. 1. Battery life. 2. Amoled screen resolution. 3. Form factor and handling of phone is good, can be slippery if held without a back cover.. 4. Camera clarity is good. 5. The hardware specs is great considering the price point. Dislikes:. 1. Feels marginally heavy when compared to rivals. 2. Bloatwares installed and notification pop-ups is annoying. 3. Pictures captured using Macro lens has noise and doesn't reflect the actual clarity.. 4. Options to toggle from within the camera application to different modes needs time to get used to, feels hectic at the initial use.. 5. Refresh rate and caching could have been better as the device slows down when several apps are all open.. My camera usage is low (<10 pics a week), have moderate number of applications and on screen usage (viewing) is about approximately 5 hours a day utmost (being practical), watching videos is pleasure on this device.. If buying a device is 1, practical understanding of hardware(specs) and usage of the device is also to be considered.. If you're someone who expects high-end features after paying for this device, Samsung alone might be able to help probably by the next decade based on competition and evolution of technology.. Unsure if people are reasonable, Samsung is.. Verdict: A great deal for the bucks spent.. (This is in no way a paid promotion).",5.0 out of 5 stars
1417,Reviewed in India on 19 September 2020,Gargi,Budget smart phone,"I have purchased the samsung gaalxy m31 with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal space. Here are the pros and cons based on my usage of the phone:. Pros :. 1) Non chinese brand. 2) affordable. 3) great camera. 4) battery life is great when you use it on power saving mode. 5) quick delivery by amazon. Cons:. 1) fingerprint sensor is terrible. Takes atleast 3 tries to get my fingerprint detected.. 2) cannot secure/lock apps. There is no inbuilt security for locking apps and app notifications. You have to download a third party app to lock your applications. 3) does not allow me to chose a sim while turning on the mobile data. You have to go the settings and change the default sim everytime you want to use another sim.(i understand this might be a weird thing to point out, but i use both my sims for internet based on the network connectivity. Hence this is a bit annoying). 4) within the first month of using the phone, i experienced the error ""UI not responding"". Although i have not encountered the same error again, but it still says something about the performance of the phone.. 5)not happy with the battery life while using the normal mode. If the phone's mobile data/wifi is on, the battery drains quickly.. Verdict : the phone is quite nice if your work is not heavily dependant on internet. With power saving mode, the battery performance is incredible. Go ahead with it if you want a budget phone with good camera, battery life and ram performance.",3.0 out of 5 stars

1419,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2020,Archit Sharma,An average smartphone,"I bought this phone on 5th March. Still working well. As it has been given a 64-megapixcel camera, it is useless to do too much expectation. Some basic features are not available in this phone like pre installed music player and no option available to change the frequency of hotspot tethering. Because of this you will not be able to connect any old version laptop etc through hotspot. Battery performance is good. If we talk about its look, then the back body is not very attractive due to the plastic material body being compared to the equivalent phone available at this time. Still seeing the price range, there is no harm in buying it. According to me, this is an average smartphone.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1420,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,Mayank Sharma,Deserves the investment..!!,"Giving a review after 5 months of heavy usage so worth reading.. Pros-. 1. Unlike every other Samsung phone which is not apt for gaming , this is the one friend. Many said me that don't go for it if you want to play but it never lagged or heated up while playing high end games.Super smooth usage and interface.. 2. Camera is drop dead awesome. It literally justifies the 64 mp quad camera.. 3. I guess no one can give a negative comment on the sleek and classy look of the phone. It feels great to hold and 10 on 10 for looks.. 4. Screen resolution and quality is also super fine.. Cons-. 1. The quick charge is almost equal to normal and there is nothing to get excited about.. 2. The battery is unable to justify 6000 mah as it claims. Other brands offering 4000mah lasts equal to this and after good all day usage u need to plug it again in the night. I expected that 6000mah will go 2 days easily but not in this case.. Conclusion- After such detailed analysis after 5 months, I can easily say that the pros can easily oustand the cons and this is one of the best budget phone Samsung has offered. And with such a reliable tag of Samsung, go for it without a second thought.. You will see that the other brands will offer somewhat same features in little less price but I would suggest you to go for this as this deserves the every extra penny spend, and ofcourse not a Chinese product.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Well, I have been using this phone for two weeks now.. The camera quality is sufficiently amazing. I am satisfied with it.. The battery is commendable. I used this phone non stop and it surpassed my expectations. It charges fast and discharges slowly.. It was so flawless that I immediately had to get a cover and screen guard on it. Because I keep dropping the phones.. Front camera and back camera are amazing but I feel like they take a while to focus, apart from that, its okay.. Its fast enough, doesn't hang yet even though I have transferred all my files, looks sturdy and flawless. I have tiny hands so I feel like its too big for me but otherwise, I'm satisfied with my purchase. I bought this with my first stipend from internship which I worked hard in.

1427,Reviewed in India on 26 November 2020,Robins Roy,Good Budget Phone,"Samsung M31 is a good budget phone. My reasons for choosing - wanted an AMOLED screen , within 18k budget.. I could be happy with a 6GB RAM, as I don't do gaming. 128 GB was required for decent storage. (add on: extra slot for SD card).. Pros: Good Battery Life, I usually put in Work Mode and Wind Down (end of day). Based on this routine, it runs about 2.5-3 days with full battery and drains to 15%.. AMOLED screen. Decent camera. Good Performance. I heard Exynos(Samsung in house) processors are decent. Cons. Takes hell lot of time to charge. From 20% to 100%, takes about 3+ hours.. Preloaded with Samsung & other spam apps.. I used to own a One Plus 3T, with a Dash Charge which i could charge to decent levels in 30 mins. This was a trade-off I had to make.

Samsung has really failed in this product. The various draw backs are as:. 1. The poor network receptor of this phone makes your calls getting dropped very often with lots of noise.. 2. The camera quality does not do justice with this price range. Many other phones under 12K offer far better quality of camera. (However, 4k video is good for this one from noise reduction and stability perspective). 3. The fingerprint sensor is really pathetic and it fails many times.. 4. The back side has started getting de-colorised.. 5. The fingerprint magnet on entire screen puts really huge amount of spots which is again a big disadvantage.. Good Side: The screen size and display are ok considering the brand of Samsung and such price.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Network issues with slow or no internet and intermittent network drops. 2. Phone is hanging sometime specially while browsing. When i tried to return it amazon is showing option to replace only and no return option available there and for replacement also they need 10-15 days.They are making sure that in case you don't like the phone still you have to stuck with it,I mean what kind of Policy and customer handling is this,this is not expected from Amazon atleast.. Also I have called customer care service but one of the senior employee was rude and implied that phone might not have any issue.. Same issues have been logged in samsung community by so many other users also.. Also,in this pandemic i think amazon is deliberately giving defective or wrong products. I have been using amazon for 5 years but never faced such issues.

The battery life is amazing, it has a wonderful standby time.. 2. Camera is wonderful. The 64mp gives an good finish in the photos.. 3. The screen is the main plus on this phone, the super AMOLED is good, even if the refresh rate is 60hz it gives a good experience while using.. 4. Even with 6000amh battery & phone weight of 191grams, the weight is evenly distributed and very comfortable to use.. 5. The phone comes with a SAMSUNG's own user interface ONE UI 2.0, it gives a premium experience for the user.. 6. Widevine certification is for this phone.. CONS. 1. There's only 15watts charger given with the phone. 25watts could have be so good(25watts is available in M31s), it roughly take around 2hr 45mins. To get 0% to 100%.. 2. The processor is Exynos 9611 which is a powerful processor for daily usage. Heavy Gaming with this processor is not advisable. High resolution games are not recommended.. 3. Low light pictures are average, SAMSUNG should work on that.. 4. M31 doesn't come with headset or back cover. I paid 17.5k for the phone, I was little bit disappointed when both cover & headset are not included. I will definitely recommend people to buy this phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1443,Reviewed in India on 23 July 2020,Amritha,Happy with what I have.,"When I was looking to upgrade from my old phone I was essentially looking for something that went along the lines of long term usage, good battery life, big storage, a decent ram speed and most of all a decent camera quality; I was looking for all of that in a mid range phone, I am a loyal Samsung customer but in the last couple of years the product was a bit disappointing so I kept myself away from it as much as I could... But when I read through the reviews and test videos for this phone I had no doubt about what my next purchase would be and I bought it after weeks and comparing and checking out other stuff and I am so happy that I decided on this to be my phone... Let's start with the following.. Battery : with 6000mh battery my days off worrying about low battery life is now all in the past, with minimal usage I easily get about 2 days of work done on my phone but if I am gaming then it's easily a day and a half to dot and that makes me a happy woman, the only thing that comes with a battery that big is it makes the phone a bit heavy but that's okay.. Camera: the picture quality is quite good for a phone at this range and even with moderate lighting the phone does a wonderful job helping you with those aspects, since I do a lot of video calling with it helps good with those aspects.. Graphics, storage and speed: it's fast, it's big with 128gb internal storage and 6gb ram space this phone gives me enough storage and functionality speed I need to do my day to day work on the phone without worrying about any lags on things, which for a mid range phone is very impressive.. Yes it has a headphone jack but the package doesn't come with a pair of ear phones that most previous phones came with but if you already have a existing ear phones that work then you don't need to worry.. Fast charge that charges you phone to full capacity within 2 and a half hours is lifesaver, I still don't know if wireless charging is a possibility but I am happy with what I have right now. Over all, I am really happy with the product I've purchased",5.0 out of 5 stars

Every time i have to delete them Manually. And the Samsung services , its like the customers have no choice their own, they have to take it otherwise this information will be a staple on upper bar of your phone(hope you get it).

1449,Reviewed in India on 26 March 2020,Swapnil Kavadi,Must read before buying. In depth review of Samsung Galaxy M31.,"Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it's M series of smartphones.. Display: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.. Rating: 5 of 5.. Battery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.. Rating: 5 of 5. Performance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it's awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that's normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it's ok at this price point.. Rating: 5 of 5. Sound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.. Sound: 4 of 5. Camera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can't be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.. Rating: 4 of 5.. Call Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word ""Excellent"". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.. Rating: 5 of 5. Storage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.. Rating: 5/5. Conclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1451,Reviewed in India on 16 June 2020,Sandesh G,"A good, well featured phone with regular samsung cons!","Well. The phone is pretty slick. With the first week of usage, some of the things i have seen. 1. Fast charging is excellent. Battery charged from 0 to 100% in about 75-80 min. Lasts about 1.5-2 days. 2. Camera is good. I'm not a heavy user of cameras but found the captures are good quality. Obviously lots of features to explore. 3. Dobly sounds makes a difference and is evident.so that's a plus.. 4. A lot of pre loaded apps. A good 3 GB gets consumed with regular apps like Netflix, Amazon and stuff.. 5. Spend time on optimising apps in terms of battery usage and permissions.. 6. I was previously using a phone which had the fingerprint sensor in front. Somehow find sensor behind a little cumbersome. Overall, a good phone in the budget range",4.0 out of 5 stars

PS:go towards the end of the comment if you wanna have a detailed review.. Overall a good phone , good performance ( it's been 1 month since I've been using the phone) .. A very good alternative to Chinese phones you can control a huge number of ads i.e no vulgar ads popping on your notification list in the morning..thank god for that.. I just have one complaint the back got scratched in this one month.. so buy a cover along with the phone.. The boring techie analysis:. The phone has improved 64MP quad rear camera,8MP for extra wide angle shorts,5MP for macro photos and 5MP for depth and 32MP front facing camera. A rear mounted finger scanner which works amazingly.... Now comming to the screen, the phone comes with FHD 6.4"" super AMOLED infinity display with infinity-U cut this is a full HD display with amazing screen quality.. Internals:. It works on 1UI version2 i.e. Android 10. With Exynos 9611 octacore processor with10nm.. Finally 6000mAh battery USB-C Port and Samsung's 15Watt adaptive fast charging",4.0 out of 5 stars
1454,Reviewed in India on 28 November 2020,Shruti,Ever worst dear customers please don't buy any thing from amazon,"3 Rd class mobile and also so called amazon seller they are really selling fake reused mobiles # don't buy anything from amazon henceforth. I bought Samsung 31 prime edition on October 2020 this the day when this mobile arrived since then I am facing issues like within a month I visited 4 times to service center due to touch issues, display issues, volume issues and also I am not able to take insurance as imei no. Is not valid as this is used so I can't take insurance as well even if you call them they will not repond properly and their technicians will visit after 8-10 days that too they haven't in my case and hence its clear that they just want money once they get it there no other responsibility of theirs everything is worst and this so called amazon brand will not take any responsibility once the product is sealed they will not even provide you the refund replace far away. I would suggest local distributors are better then this so called amazon. If you really want worth product dear customers please buy any items not only mobiles from particular company online portals or from local distributors but no from this so called fake online sellers I am totally unsatisfied with amazon even flipkart is better place then amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars

1457,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,anmol ratna,Disappointed!!!,Edit: After 8 mnths of use I am decreasing the rating from 5 to 1.. Reasons:. 1. The battery takes ages (3+hours) to get fully charged.. 2. The battery drains very fast and with medium usage u may need to charge twice a day.. 3. The phone heats up frequently.. 4. U can't uninstall apps like FB from phone.. Even if i ignore 1st 3 points I won't buy a samsung phone again because of 4th point. Because you can't deny the user the right to keep or unistall any app from his mobile. Poor ethics.,1.0 out of 5 stars

I am using this phone for the last 3 months. I selected this phone for the battery backup 6000mAh and internal memory 128GB. I am happy as the phone performs well in these requirements. Please note that the network signal is not good at my office location and naturally phone would get discharge very fast. After full charge at 08:00 AM my phone battery capacity is showing at 47% at 11:00 PM at night. 64 mega pixel quad Camera at rear side. Picture quality is good. We can adjust the brightness while taking photos. Wide lens option for group photos is quite useful. Slow motion and super slow motion options are available. Fingerprint sensor is fast. On the box ""made in India"" label is printed and I feel proud. Arogyasetu app is running with bluetooth on 24X7. Ear phones are not part of package.

1459,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Coolbiatch,Honest review after 2 months of usage,"Fingerprint reader at a weird place, if you use covers it'll be even more difficult to use.. Fairly good face detection, so I use that often to unlock phone. Though difficult to detect when in dark.. Super artificially enhanced and processed output from both the cameras. Would love some naturals captures that's just impossible. Not a good camera. Aap you can see in the first picture, the room is moderately lit but image is pretty bright, the details are lacking and the image is not as sharp. The second image is of outdoors, good lighting and a little enhanced colours, though if I zoom in the picture will be distorted and lacks details, which is not expected from a 64 mp camera.. Amazing display, lovely colours. Same goes with the touch.. Battery lasts for well more than a day on moderate usage with data on all day long, which is great.. Performance is good, not best not poor either.. Don't play games at all, no clue/opinion about it.. Great after sales service, I received a call to check in and review the device. Looking forward to get some significant improvements in upcoming products.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1460,Reviewed in India on 30 June 2020,Mr. Bangi,All m31 hearing Volume is too soft. Can't hear the conversation properly.,"The volume of the phone is so low that it make me difficult to hear the conversations. We have three mobiles Samsung A5, Xiomi redmi note4 and redmi Y3 when compared with the old mobiles the new Samsung M31 has the least volume. So far A5 and xiomi note4 was the best deal. I bought Samsung again after buying 2 mobiles from redmi keeping in the mind of A5 but Samsung made a blunder this time. I want to either return or exchange with another one. Waiting for Amazon to take the product back. Even the second phone has the same problem. It means all m31 has low hearing volume. Samsung must do something to solve this problem.",3.0 out of 5 stars

1462,Reviewed in India on 30 November 2020,Amal,Best for long hour users,"In a nutshell:. Pros:. Battery life is pretty good, the two options in the battery saver mode is really something. Got almost 8hr battery life from just 4% in the most saving mode.. The visual quality is good, especially while watching some videos.. The touch screen is very responsive hence it's easy to write long paragraphs in it.. Cons:. Bulky and heavy, hence tiring if taking it along in hands.. It's not able to handle much multi-tasking. It's good enough if you just use it for normal work stuffs.. The bulging of the camera is something to watch out for as within just two weeks I already got a scratch, it's something to watch out for.. Overall: it's a really good phone if you want to use for official work and you need to travel a lot and doesn't get much time to charge. Recommended for anyone looking for work phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars

When we use this smartphone it really feels like we have a device with all the features that we get on a Laptop/Desktop. The camera quality is also best as every snapped photo has pinpoint details. The slow motion feature is the one that I liked the most and we can even edit the recorded videos on this device itself. The last but not the least is its sound quality of speaker and headphones mode is really remarkable plus outstanding.

The premium quality experience you enjoy on display is beyond expectation in this range.. The finger print is also pretty good along with facial recognition feature which will suffice at this price.. Slim design is unbelievable considering the fact that it's packed with 6000mah battery and on that note, one must not forget how efficiently Samsung has managed to balance and maintain its weight.. Gaming experience is really treat to your eyes as well as your soul, not just saying but actually tried playing Call of Duty(mobile), Asphalt 9 Legends and FIFA, once again what graphic quality at this level of price range.. Camera quality is something you cannot avoid talking in Samsung phone, which in this case also, it beats all the budget phones camera in its segment..

However, Less than 6 months down, the phone begins to restart every 3-5 minutes and on opening any app. Samsung services quoted motherboard failure and that the model is replaced by m31s now, so spares not available. They have applied for a refund on the full bill value and will provide me a coupon to redeem on the Samsung store for another phone. The sad thing is I got this at 16000 and now the m31s are pegged at 20000 so have to end up spending 4-6k more on buying another Samsung phone.

With 6000 mah battery the weight balance is amazing.. Build quality is good ( glass back would have made it much heavier). Cons:. With the monster battery the charger should have been a beast too ( 15 W charger takes a lot of time to fully charge the phone)..

1478,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,Shihas Aboobacker,"A Mega Monster that got everything big , but with limitations..","Display: FHD+ is Super Amazing, the latest M31s with punch hole instead of the notch would be a better experience.. Finger Print: Mostly works, but at times don't react at all as if you haven't touched it and will have to try again after pressing the lock button.. Camera: Lot of options if interested in Photography and making Videos.Would have to explore with all the modes to get an idea of its capabilities especially if you were using a single camera phone earlier. Videos aren't so great in low lights and Indoor photos depends on the lighting condition but fair enough.. Macro is a bit disappointing. Overall good. Hope they give all the software update for the great features of the latest M31s.. Battery:  1 day is for sure, can get up to 2 days on a minimal to average usage. But sadly 15 W charger, you will have to keep it aside for along time once it drains off Or else you will have to remember to charge it during the times you are sure that you won't be using the phone. Hope this had the 25W fast charger like in the latest M31s..

1479,Reviewed in India on 8 April 2021,Vid,"No hanging, overheating or battery issues. Macro cam is best.","Camera quality is really good, gives you flexible options. But you can't zoom in 64mp mode, thus cannot take distance photos. Loved the Macro cam. Battery takes a long time to charge comparatively. Battery life is good. It lasts at least for a day and half if you charge it full and even though you keep using internet and other apps. Finger print reader is very average. You have to keep tapping and wiping Fingers. Worst part is the location of the charging and headphone points. Most of the mobile phones have these on the top, but M31 has it at the bottom. So there are high chances of cable cutting if you use it while charging. Even the screen couldn't rotate in a few apps such as whatsapp calls, so end up seeing only revese images , or cannot operate while charging.. The device supports all sort of apps used for official purposes, such as drive, all sort of virtual meeting options. I ran Google meet, zoom, webex, MS Teams and it went very smooth.. I have been using it since last four months and has not caused any major trouble such as hanging, battery issues or overheating.

The phone stopped charging two days ago. I visited your Authorized Service Center, Shree Rama Krishna Enterprise@Jodhpur cross roads, Ahmedabad today at 3.30pm.. The executive who attended me on table 2 was very rude and very roughly said to me that my mobile charging point was liquid damaged and cannot be covered in warranty.. I do not understand how does liquid goes into the Charging Point??. Are we so ignorant that we will charge the phone in liquid??. When I asked him to give this me in written the store manager or someone of the kind asked me to pay Rs.175 for the same. I paid or the same.. After all this mental harassment I had to wait for 20 grueling minutes at the center for them to hand over the letter to me.. I, surely didn't expect this type of response from an authorized service center of a reputed company like Samsung. I am utterly disappointed with this type of response..

1481,Reviewed in India on 22 August 2020,Shantanu Hanchate,Very satisfied with the product 🙂👍,"Been using this phone (Space Black, 8GB/128GB) variant since 30th of June. Absolute bang for your buck. Even though the processor isn't Best-In-Class, it delivers smooth performance. Haven't experienced any lag, stutter or excessive heating up. This phone has got the basics right. Out of words for the battery life. Camera is also good, but not the best. Facial recognition is decent.. Pros:. Crisp display, 6000mAh battery, superfast fingerprint unlock, smooth performance, great speakers, overall high Value-For-Money product.. Cons:. Poor low-light camera performance, night mode is terrible, poor video stabilization, facial recognition is a little slow if not held from a fixed angle, plastic back is a fingerprint magnet, hence atleast a random back case should have been provided.. Rating: 9.2/10. Highly recommended!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bought for MOM,"My mom has been constantly complaining of issues with the phone, i.e. like the phone keyboard sometimes not responding to touch, the audio jack breaking the earphone sound, the fingerprint not always responding. Or not getting the calls over whats-app.. She has used Android phones for a long time already.. So i think most could be software problems, so i installed appropriate once for her to make it work better. I am still looking up on the internet if the phone has some persistent hardware or software issues, like with the wifi card because of which intermittent connectivity problems could occur..

It is comparable to Note 10 Lite! I checked that by myself. The USP must be the quad camera setup with 64 megapixel being the main camera. I also like the stabilization in video recording even in wide angle lense. This is great features for vloggers. And cherry on top is the massive battery. This is probably the best mid range offering from Samsung till date.,5.0 out of 5 stars
1487,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2020,bhupesh,Yes it is beast... but beast has some weak points too,Its almost 1 month since i bought this mobile. 1st impression is impressive... you cannot resist picking it up again and again... check every angle.. every service. Every settings... its marvelous.... Camera is good for normal user... but for pro's i would not recommend it.. though you can work it out with little change in settings and here and there... autofocus is not that good but definitely not that bad too... fingerprint gives trouble sometime but other than that it works like a charm... the only issue i had it that samsung did not provide a light border around it... so user could feel it and pace finger correctly.. the day it arrived.. i downloaded many application from microsoft word to evernote... whatsapp to skype pubG to candy crush... more the 150 app are there currently on my device but no issue of speed while switching 1 to another.. though it gets little heat up while playing pubG but not that much... and lo lagging so far.... And above all boss 6000 mah battery... for normal user ... if you charge your phn 100% and in normal use taking phone calls.. texting chatting..listening music.. playing normal games... it last 70-75 % at the end of day... woooow.... I am not an high end user... and i am well aware about price range... so for me ints 4 out of 5... but for those who need everything perfect kindly incrrase your budget till 20k i must say m31 slay every predator around it.....,3.0 out of 5 stars

1491,Reviewed in India on 17 July 2020,subham,Great product at a budget,"A good budget phone with some pretty decent features.. I've used it for almost 10days. So according to me the pros and cons are listed below.. Pros. -----. * Color reproduction of camera is nice and display the almost accurate colors.. * Video stabilization is up to the mark. * Amoled screens are always glamorizing. * AI battery optimization (depending on your usage pattern the battery will auto optimize. It'll take some to time to learn the pattern). * Many levels of customization including fonts, themes, gestures, etc.. * Processor is good enough to handle day to day multitasking. I don't play games on regular basis but games like pubg, asphalt and cod are playble (at 45-60fps). Some graphics tweaks will boost the performance.. * Single speaker but loud enough for basic usage. Cons. ------. * Charging takes almost 2h 45m to boost from 0 to 100.. * Night mode could be optimized.. Go for this phone if you're looking for a budget phone with decent features, good security patterns, long battery life and an amazing camera for outdoor and selfie shots.. Note: This phone may not be suitable for gamers due to the exonys Processor. According to the benchmarks it's more powerful than a SD 675 but slower than SD 720. Go for phones with 720G or 730G.. #MadeInIndia",5.0 out of 5 stars

The problem which i found is that if this phone is charged in warmer environment(30-40 °C) then its charging speed is slow and phone gets little warm eg it take me 2.75 hrs for charging my phone from 25 to 100%. And if it is not hot outside then it will take 2 hrs for the same. Other features like camera, fingerprint sensor, and screen quality are best in class. The face unlock is little slow in first time when used after more screen lock time. But phone is best and it's value for money phone..

Coming to the point, I'm very much satisfied with this product but I'd like to list 2 problems which I've been facing, the 1st being the charging problem as it takes hell lot of time to get charged, on an approx 3 hours to get full charged but I see they've improved this experience in their latest model M31s. Secondly, I feel the network reception is not as expected. I've been working from home ever since the pandemic started using hotspot & I do feel it's capacity to stay consistent in terms of network is just satisfactory. While I'll be attending meetings sometimes it will be a problem as I'll face network breakage, I insist Samsung to take this point into consideration & improve in the next releases.

So many bugs, like google chrome won't update for reasons best known to them.. Secondly, talking about camera, its decent but in slo mo, it gets hazy and blurred.. Thirdly, battery, 6000mah they claim it to be, but its not upto the mark. The battery drains faster. I was using a Honor 9 lite having 3000 mah battery before this device and usage is same but the drainage rate is almost same.. Now coming to performance, heating issues are there, a few minutes of video call on whatsapp heats the device up. Also as its Samsung, lags are there in place.. Network issues are also there, like in my previous phone which costed me around 9k, I had full 4g network but in this device on the same spot, I'm just getting 2 bars and that's all. it quickly changes to 3g as well. So it a no go.. Updated the phone but this won't get resolved.. Display is just amazing. Simply amazing..

Coming to the last point bighest issue is with the wifi detector/antenna inside the mobile is worst one. You will gave frequent disconnection of the wifi every 5 mins ones the wifi will go away automatically and then detects after 10 seconds.

1499,Reviewed in India on 29 May 2020,Meenal Anwikar,Best Budget Phone,"This phone is worth buying. I will list pros and cons.. Here are the pros:. 1. The very first thing to mention is the camera setup. The image quality is too good in this price range. Both front and rear camera can shoot FHD videos with slomo videos as well. The 64MP shooter does satisfying job.. 2. Second thing where samsung never disappoints is the 6.4 inches super AMOLED screen which is the best. The colors are very natural and prominent.. 3. The huge battery is far away from other phone which has endurance of around 1 and half days even after heavy use.. 4. The exynos 9611 works well for daily use.. 5. The phone is not at all heavy even if it has huge battery. The weight balance of this phone is great. Thumbs up for that.. 6. The One UI is the best. It gives a smooth experience on top of android 10.. 7. Physical fingerprint and face unlock both are fast.. Here are the cons:. 1. First thing, I dont know why samsung is putting the same processor in all of their mid rangers. Though Exynos 9611 does a good job of daily use. But it will disappoint heavy users.. 2. The macro camera works good in better light conditions, though it is just to attract the customers.. 3. I have seen some glitches while switching apps. Hopefully samsung will take care of it in sytem updates.. 4. The speaker is decent but it gets covered while using phone and you may face problems while playing media.. 5. The deisgn of this phone is not eyecatching but its definitely not bad as reviewers tell.. 6. Samsung could have provided at least 25W charger. Charging speed is slow but its always a trade-off about what you need.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The advanced display beats the competition hands-down, with images being far superior to the standard Oled; the number of cameras, especially the 64MP one performs flawlessly, though not as well in low light conditions, but the images are good enough to pass the test easily!.

After using it for good 10 days here's my review:. BATTERY LIFE- The battery on this one is the star. This 6000mAh powerhouse does deliver. Even after 3 hrs of video calling, power consumption is just 20%. Intense gaming, use of camera, e mails,online video playback and lots more, it can handle anything you throw at it. Charging is slow but you have to consider that 6000mAh battery would take some time to charge up. You charge it once and wouldn't need to do it again for the entire day.. 2. DISPLAY: In this area also the AMOLED display will win you over, with the drop notch design is very pleasing to the eyes, colour and contrast are also great.. 3. CAMERA: The pictures are amazing in bright light, the wide angle lens also works fine, however macro or low light pictures may not be up to the mark. 64 MP sensor is not default and have to be changed in the camera settings. But the picture do have great depth, colour, contrast and resolution. The 64 mp camera performs better than other mobile phones in terms of clarity and true colour..

Due to fair cost and its salient features M31 is attracting more and more costumers in the market and I too recommend to buy M31 if you are looking for a good phone",5.0 out of 5 stars
1514,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Pritam Sen,"Go Blind, No Regret Even 1%","Firstly , I am not writing a review. This what exactly I felt, I have shared below.. 1st, I got a such a phone which actually last 02days battery with decent use. Trust me none of the phone has this capability till now.. 2nd, Low light camera is awesome. I took a picture at 19:30hrs at minimum street light which actually look like I took the picture at 16:30hrs in sunlight.. 3rd, Others camera feature is awesome , which I am not saying, my picture saying that.. 4. Front camera is also good, clear.. 5. Screen flash is enough to give you decent quality pic at zero light.Frankly speaking I did a lot of experiments in a dark room.. 6. It never heat up when charging. One or 02 days it heated up when I was charging at middle of the day and outside temperature was 42°c. Otherwise in the morning time it charge quick and fast.. 7. My friends told me dont buy samsung as samsung phone hang a lot. I have use 2 samsung phone earlier, so I know they are right but still I bought this phone for camera as 64mp samsung camera, so I ignore that. After using a month I gave my phone and said use as much as application, if it will hang I will give this phone free. They use 15 applications at a time and playing pubg in this phone. They did not found any lags even.. 8. The ram availability is less 3.4 to 3.6 while not using. While using still you will have 1.4 gb available after using 12 applications were opened.. 9. Fingerprint reader work fast , accurate better than my last phone J7 max.. 10. Look wise it gives the feeling of Samsung S20 phone, lite weight . Better than any phone.. Dear all, go blind for this , you will not regret 1% even.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Battery lasts for a day, with frequent use of maps, multimedia, office mails and chat. Recommend to use phone back cover as it is too soft and scratched. Camera works perfectly fine in dim light. Fingerprint sensor is very responsive and even unlocking of phone with front camera works fine. Some gesture controls (screen shot and single hand use) could be improved. Works fine with Airtel and considerably good WiFi calling function. Let's see how long it lasts with my rough usage.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1517,Reviewed in India on 3 September 2020,Rohit,User review for Galaxy M31,"As far as the hardware is considered they are no issues but when it comes to software, there's a lot to be improved. The current UI isn't compactable with the phone and because of that, there are flickering issues while using google but other than this there aren't any major issues.. Since it is a mid-range budget phone it isn't ideally meant for gaming. If any high-end graphics games are considered like COD or pubg, the phone heats up real fast thereby reducing the battery life.. There haven't been any issues with the touch like I said earlier. The features provided for this price are really good.. Coming to the camera, I'd give 4.5/5 ratings. I've uploaded sample photos taken on this phone. All the features provided are extremely good but in professional mode, there isn't an option to control the shutter speed(only con). Also, the camera needs a lot of light to capture every minute detail if shooting in low light the images are all husky.. Overall I'd recommend, if you are looking for an exclusive good camera-based and daily usage, it's the best option.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1518,Reviewed in India on 19 August 2020,Amazon Customer,Review from a Non-Gamer,"I believe that this is a perfect phone for me. I wanted a phone which had a great battery with a good camera. And this is better than I could have imagined.. The battery is just massive. It lasts me easily more than 2 days. Even after the 2nd day it is around 20%. So if you're someone who wants a phone which lasts more than 2 days then go for it.. The camera is great too. You have the choice if you want to take pictures in 64 MP or not. As 64MP takes a lot of size.. The quality of the pictures are perfect too.. As I said I don't play games, so I would not be able to comment on that. But if you're someone who likes to watch videos and use the phone for non-gaming reasons then you cannot ask for a better device.. One UI feels good too. Much better than MI and other smartphone's UI.. Plus the cherry on top of the cake is that it is not from a Chinese company. So you won't have to feel guilty about that.. TLDR: Go for it. It has a great camera, battery, and feels quite premium to me.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1521,Reviewed in India on 3 June 2020,Vignesh Sridharan,Unmatched Value at this Price!,"The reason I went for the M31 was because most reviews I adjudged it as ""bang for the buck"", and because Samsung is a trusted brand. I was familiar with the M series as my mother owns an M30s and after a week of using this phone, I am glad I made the decision to buy it.. Firstly, the most amazing thing about the M31 is the battery life. The battery comfortably lasts for more than 30 hours with moderately heavy use. The 15W charger keeps charging times fairly low. The M31 comes with Android 10 pre-loaded and the dark mode is something I really love! The performance is smooth, the UI is neat and clean, and the display looks crisp with good vibrancy. I really like the camera's performance in daylight and the quality of the images is quite sharp. However, I felt that low light photos are quite decent and could be better. The phone feels slightly heavier than the M30s because of the bigger battery but the difference is not very noticeable. I bought the Space Black version and while it looks classy, it does pick up fingerprints easily. I would recommend getting a case for that reason, even though the phone is quite comfortable to grip. Ergonomically, the buttons are well-placed and the fingerprint sensor works really well. I feel that on the whole, the phone is perfect for anyone looking for a durable device that can cover all the bases within the 15-20K range!. PROS. - Battery Life. - Daylight Camera. - Display. - Android 10 UI. CONS. - Night Shots. - Spammy notifications (can be easily disabled)",5.0 out of 5 stars

Battery life is totally monstrous as Samsung displayed. 2. Some of us are used to have habit of clicking here it is providing Camera with beautiful contrast, Rear and Front both are master in their category with some latest features.. 3. Display, the best I have ever used. SUPER AMOLED and smooth and shiny comes with Gorilla glass which is also provided in camera glass cover which can melt anyone's heart.. 4. Ram and Processor are legends in this category, Anyone can choose different variants as per his/her usage, I am using 6/128 and feels getting faster and smoother 😎. 5. Nice Gameplay,. 6. Provides latest updates and compatible features. 7. Music and audio with Dolby Atmos as always which is the best thing about Samsung phones.

Pro:. 1. The first thing that you notice is that the mobile feels pretty lightweight for a 6000mAh battery pack with impressive performance.. 2. The 6.4inch FHD+ SAMOLED panel - best display in the price range.. 3. Versatile rear quad camera setup and front facing camera with very decent image quality, great video performance under daylight.. 4. Refined One UI 2.0 with Android 10 out of the box makes the device snappy to use and.. 5. The physical rear finger print scanner works pretty fast, accurate and even when the finger is wet.. 6. RAM management is quite good and storage provided is great which can also be expanded upto 512GB.. 7. Price.. Cons:. 1. The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason. But at this price tag a Snapdragon 712 or 730 SoC chipset would be make this mobile an aggressive one.. 2. The camera performance under low-light conditions is poor and makes the image look smooth lacking details. Same in the case of zooming into the subject during daylight. And again this is the only downside for such a good camera setup.. My experience with this mobile is quite satisfactory so far and I would recommend buying this mobile.

Charging time also seems to be longer considering that the phone comes with a fast charger. However, the reason I have given it 3 stars, or may be should have given 2 stars, is because on unboxing, there were some white particles (like fine thermocol pieces) on the handset plastic covering. There was a white mark on the charger; thought it would go off on wiping but the mark persisted. Probably, the charger was mishandled during packing. There was also a white mark near the volume button; again, the mark persisted after wiping. The phone was properly packed, and the seal was intact. Hence, unlikely that the set was tampered with, hopefully. Probably, standard quality check protocols were not followed during packing.",3.0 out of 5 stars

With the likes of Redmi note pro max and poc x2 and other competitors, I was not able to choose the better one. But anyways I went ahead with M31. And no regrets.. Delivery: 10/10. Packaging: 10/10. Overall: 9/10. Camera: 8/10. Sound: 7/10. UI: 10/10. Exynoss Processor: 9/10. Fingerprint scanner: 10/10. I'm not a gamer. So this phone is best for day to day use. I cannot comment on other phones though. And also you would decide not to purchase this phone if you see the negative reviews it's got. But I would say it's worth a buy.. Review after one month :. Same performance, good battery backup. No heating issues.. But , I just compared M31 with Poco X3, and without a doubt x3 is way better than m31 except for Amoled Screen.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1553,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Ajai Bhasker,It's a winner!!,"This mobile is one of the best in its price range. Firstly, the battery is rock solid. At 6000 mah, it comes for more than one and a half day's usage for a hard user like me. The display is kickass and the other features like finger print sensor and face recognition works fast too. On the design front, M31 looks like an identical twin of M30s except for the camera module which houses 4 lenses.. The quad cam is good for daylight shooting. In the night, it does feel that Samsung could've done better. But again, considering the price range and other features packed in the phone, its forgivable, I would say. The charging is quite slow because of the 6000 mah battery.. This is my third day with the phone and wrt to the first impression, I can say that this phone is a winner. If your are planning to buy one, I would recommend you to buy the 128 GB version. Hardly 1000 bucks more than the 64 GB version. But with the amount of photos and videos you are gonna shoot with this superb camera, I am sure you would want to have more memory.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1554,Reviewed in India on 29 August 2020,NIraj Sah,"Not a good one , disappointed by Samsung",I didn't expect this type of worst product from Samsung. The new mobile: The space between bottom right edge and top left edge of finger print scanner is heavily bump. Suddenly mobile stops sensing fingerprint. Sometime can't get open by using fingerprint. And now only screen touch stopped working. And hence I have to press up down volume and power button all at a same time to restart it again. It's not even a month and I am feeling I had wasted my money on this model. Proximity sensor doesn't work properly. I had not yet used any game or any other heavy Apps and this is the condition. really I am very disappointed by Samsung. I am not going to suggest any one to have this mobile. I am sure Samsung had compromised the model by using cheap hardware,1.0 out of 5 stars

The sleek handset with its broad 6.4-inch display is remarkable. Android version 10.0 with an octa-core processor, allows smooth working of the smartphone. Its interface is very user friendly. With its unique features like 4 screen split, M31 is a handy device for people of all tiers and arenas. The long lasting battery life is the most important feature for people with busy and hectic schedules. Lastly, the most commendable camera setup of 64MP+8MP with an Ultra wide lens and 32MP front facing camera is the highlight of the handset. The clarity and depth of the lens is amazing and for people who love photography its an equivalent to a professional camera. Its a treat for technology lovers and a boon for all.

Also Comes with lot of Samsung apps which seems too much for a new phone, had to uninstall many of them, themes, wallpapers were all outdated.

1596,Reviewed in India on 19 August 2020,Rahul Mishra,Worth throwing in DUSTBIN,"Do not buy this phone as I had also bought Samsung M30s a year back and here is my experience:. The phone has suddenly stopped working within warranty. The phone didnt drop, no short-circuit, no water leak etc. I go to service center and they say motherboard is damaged. Also, it is not under warranty and it will cost 9000 Rs to fix the motherboard while the official website of Samsung says it is 6800 Rs. I said what to do now as i dont want to spend 9000 rs on a 14-15K phone, so they say you can throw the phone in e-waste bin.. DO NOT buy samsung as it is a fraud company with flimsy hardware that stops working for no reason. I was not doing any gaming/hardware intensive applications still the phone used to lag. Battery drains within a day without any use after few months and does not fit 6000 MAh as claimed by the company.. I think the service employee was right, all its worth is being thrown in the DUSTBIN.",1.0 out of 5 stars

The camera is so good, you can yourself look at the beautiful colours and details captured.. •The battery is 6000mah which is huge but personally since I am a very heavy user it doesn't lasts for more than a day.. •The phone has the normal Samsung theme structure with options of course. But the basic user feeling is the same (as I have been a Samsung user since last 2 years).. •The phone looks beautiful but a little chunky and heavy. That is obviously because of the huge battery. But the weight distribution is done well hence you won't feel the weight.. •The camera is terrific with amazing features. You have slo-motion in the front camera as well. Not only the rear camera but the front camera is also very sharp with beautiful colours.. •Its been a few days since I am using this phone and by far I have experienced no lags and the phone works fine.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Its battery takes a lot of tike to charge...but once charged alcan be used forever. Okay so, the phone is better than any other phone launched recently. I guess its been some weeks since i have been using this but this monster feels just like a brand new one.. My suggestion is never put a screen guard or a tempered glass on the phone coz it lags the phone and touch response becomes really bad BUT..there s a setting for the screen guard users to increase sensitivity and it goes smooth again. The phone s brilliant and i love the performance and its very light in weight. The battery backup is cool and long lasting.. I literally watched a 3 hour movie with just 16percent charge in phone...

Main camera - Best in class.. 2. Wide camera - no competition at this price.. 3. Depth sensor - works great 99% of time.. 4. Macro camera - details are good but theres not much usability because of lack of autofocus.. 5. Front camera - Again great, clicks amazing pictures, live focus works in almost every condition where there is decent lighting.. ● Battery life is better than any phone at this price point.. ● Finger print reader is really fast, even works with slightly wet fingers.. ● processor (soc) - Exynos 9611 is very good CPU for daily usage, but if you are buying this for gaming then please refrain from buying this phone, not that good gaming performance compared to other phones at this price point.. ● 6 GB RAM is more than enough for any work you do in this phone... app reset in backgrounds in very rare because of huge RAM size.... ● AND MAIN FOCUS - THE AMOLED DISPLAY - the display is simply gorgeous... pixel density is great, watching HD or 4K movies is very pleasing in this display....

If you're a type of user who relies on mobile data, please stay away. This phone is not for you. Unfortunately for me, I realised this problem after the return window closed on amazon. I'm stuck with this thing now. There are many complaints registered on Samsung Members. Samsung is doing nothing about it except some silly settings advices. I'm no techie but I firmly believe it's a hardware issue.. I've always been a Motorola user and it works brilliantly with the same sim (Airtel).

Having spent 5 months with this phone, I would say that the 2 major drawbacks of this phone are its battery/charging and multitasking.. The charging is slow and it takes atleast 6hrs for a 5% to 100% charge. That is a lot of time but if you can put it for an overnight charge, it would run you through the day with your heaviest of the usage.. Coming to multitasking, i have seen this device give latency issues while multiple app usage, it hanged twice in 5 months.. At times, Fingerprint scanner also disappoints, need to press it for longer times than usual.. Camera happens to be the best part of this device, check out the images attached..

1627,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2020,Pranam Sinha,Best all rounder budget phone,"The phone is best for both the students and the commoners. As I am a student, this phone is apt for everything. The biggest selling point of this phone is that it has got a 6000 mAh battery capacity which could go for at least 2 days with all the full usage of the phone. So people always search for pros and cons of a particular device. This thing has also got some of them.. Pros:. 1. The massive battery capacity 6000 mAh is enough to attend all your live classes, do all your assignments and even some good gaming.. 2. The screen size is very good. Not too big neither too small. It's in between. So the phone is very handy and useful.. 3. The 64 MP camera is I think the best camera in the world. Compiling it with macro and ultarwide this phone is a camera beast in itself and can take some awesome night shoots as well as potraits.. 4. Both the fingerprint sensor and face id is fast enough. Unlocks the phone in no time and locks the phone as the screen goes off.. 5. This thing can do some pretty performance in gaming. Its not a gaming phone but can handle it like a pro.. 6. This phone has also got Dolby Atmos which can work only through Bluetooth devices but when paired up it produces a good music quality.. Cons:. 1. This thing has a plastic back which invites a lot of fingerprints, grudges and scratches on the back of the phone.. 2. Does not provide a case in the box. You have to purchase it seperately.. 3. To charge a 6000 mAh battery the box provides only a 15w of charger which takes like 3 full hours to charge this thing up.. 4. It does not have samsung pay nor it has bixby. So that makes the phone not to be used in payments.. 5. Does not come with an earphone in the box. Though it has a 3.5mm headphone jack but still you have to purchase it seperately.. But I think this phone is preety darn good. It can handle anything from classes to gaming to assignments to voice calls. Even it's speaker is good even if you are not using Bluetooth headsets.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1631,Reviewed in India on 15 August 2020,Aditya,Detailed review. Hope it helps :),"Really good product.. been using for a couple of week right now.. Let's look at this in a good fashioned Pros/Cons manner shall we?... Pros :. 1. Super Amoled Screen : The super Amoled screen is a blessing in disguise and its one of those things that you don't know you needed until you get it.. after using this phone or any samsung phone with sAmoled screen you would be really disappointed with any other phone you get purely because of the screen quality.. I've watched and rewatched many movies in my phone as the quality is literally mesmerizing which just couldn't be achieved by my laptop screen.. 2. Camera : Goes without saying that the camera is really good. By default it does not use 64mp camera as pictures taken in 64mp have really large sizes but you can change the camera quality to 64mp from within the camera app.. the photo quality is similar to the category of iPhones/Pixels as in the camera is more lifelike and 'real' rather than the oppo/vivo immensely beautified camera.. super slow motion, super stable mode, 4k video capture are really good functionalities if you're into that sort of thing.. 3. Performance : 6gb ram is really good and the samsung processor with android 10 os properly optimizes the phone to perform various operations simultaneously without overheating problem.. 4. Gaming : I consider myself as a casual gamer and have faced no lag in any game that I've played even in really high graphics settings(in games like PUBG, Call of Duty, Asphalt 9, Sky, etc). 5. Fast Charging : the 15W fast charging adapter charges the phone very quickly so you don't have to wait and stare at the wall while waiting for your phone to charge for too long.. 6. Design : I've got the space black model and saying that the overall design combining the screen, edges, back design, camera placement, etc is stunningly gorgeous would be an understatement.. 7. Made in India and Not a Chinese Company : Samsung is a south Korean company with its biggest headquarters in Noida.. Many more pros but This review is getting kinda lengthy...so now Cons. Cons:. 1. Battery: Not really a major con as the battery is actually really good and lasts for a long time but still it doesn't quite feels like the 6000mAh battery advertised.. 2. Apps Hide: you can hide the apps from the menu but you can't truly hide an app as it can be searched from the search bar (maybe there is a different option to hide but so far I couldn't find one like the other Samsung mobiles). 3. 14-15 volume level gap : the audio volume gap from level 14 to level 15(max) is kinda high and sometimes it's tough to find a sweet spot.. These are the only cons that I've come across till now.. Final Review : I would definitely suggest everyone to get this phone just for the sAmoled screen only. All the pros definitely outweigh the cons and for this budget this phone is a definite must buy.. I've used other phones in this price range too like the pocoX2 etc and trust me this phone is far better than anyother phone in this price range... If you are looking to buy a phone in this price range or even in a little higher price range you should get this phone as it won't disappoint.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1634,Reviewed in India on 19 August 2020,Suman L.,Worth Every Penny,"Though I am very skeptical about smartphones still I liked this Galaxy M31device very much. Here is my brief review about cam, battery, processor, ram and storage.. #Camera quality is great (the best in this price range) in daylight. Low light capturing is also good, but not very good. You may find little noise while taking photos in low light (specially indoors). I expected a bit better. Full hd video recording feature with both the rear and selfie camera is a great added feature. Specially new youtube vloggers. 64mp main, wide angle, macro overall a well crafted cam setup. Depth sensor is also good with new options. But while taking protrait mode (live focus mode in this case) finishing of the blurry edges could have been better.. #Battery is damn good and it does what it says (in the ads). If you are not a heavy user u can easliy survive one day and a half (even 2days, depends upon your usage) without charging.. if you play games like pubg, free fire frequently you will get a whole day with single charge for sure. And no heating issues at all.. #Proccessor is wellcrafted for multitasking and with the support of 6gb #RAM it is great. Your regular work, social media, internet surfing, live streaming, movie watching, music and gaming will go very soomthly without any lag. But if you play high end graphic games or games like pubg with full graphics, after an hour or so you will see drop in the frame rates. Otherwise overall experience is good.. #Massive #storage of 128gb is definitely a feature liked by all no doubt. And you can easily upgrade it to more by simply adding a sd card in the dedicated sd card slot.. As per my view, go for Samsung Galaxy M31..you wont regret it. 😊",5.0 out of 5 stars

1636,Reviewed in India on 14 August 2020,Utkarsh Sriram,Another compelling budget Galaxy phone,"When Samsung launched the Galaxy M30s last year, we were shocked to see how competitively the company had managed to price the phone. The M30s instantly made the Galaxy A50 feel too costly, and rightly so: Except for the in-display fingerprint sensor and better looking design, the Galaxy A50 was pretty much the same phone as the M30s, only with a considerably smaller battery.. Samsung could simply have let the 6,000 mAh battery on the M30s be the highlight, but it didn’t. The Galaxy M30s had the new Exynos 9611 processor under the hood, a 48MP triple camera setup at the back, and a beautiful 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel up front. In fact, Samsung told us at the Galaxy M31 launch that the camera, battery life, and display are the most important factors for young people nowadays, and those are the parameters it focused on when designing the Galaxy M31.. However, since the battery life and display quality on the M30s were pretty top notch for the asking price, Samsung has focused on the camera experience with the Galaxy M31. There’s a 64MP camera at the back along with a macro camera, in addition to an ultra-wide camera and a depth sensor, while the front-facing camera has been upgraded to a 32MP sensor. Does the M31 have what it takes to be the amazing value proposition that the Galaxy M30s was last year? Let’s find out!. Galaxy M31 design and display. The Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that’s pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there’s a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn’t feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone’s liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.. At the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ’64 megapixels’ mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There’s also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phones.. The 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight. However, since this is the same panel as the one on the Galaxy M30s, the bezels are rather big for a 2020 smartphone. The bottom bezel in particular is an eyesore, though I guess we can’t complain considering the M31’s price tag.. The Galaxy M31 has a headphone jack, for those wondering. But you will have to buy your own headphones, as there are no earphones in the box. There’s no case, either: All you get is a USB-C cable and a 15W Samsung fast charger, which was also the case (no pun intended) with the Galaxy M30s. You will need a case, though, if you want to keep the phone in a pristine condition, as the back panel picks up scratches very easily.. Galaxy M31 camera. The M31 is Samsung’s cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There’s plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.. It’s the nighttime performance where the M31 drops the ball. First off, the phone simply has too much shake even when you hold it in two hands, and with a single hand, well, good luck getting a perfectly clear picture. If you do manage it, you get sufficient detail and little noise when there’s good artificial lighting around. In the dark, things aren’t so rosy. Samsung is marketing the M31 as having an amazing camera Night mode, but that Night mode isn’t exactly that great.. First off, the Night mode photos are cropped considerably so you see a lot less in the frame compared to standard photos. Secondly, Night mode photos have a watercolor painting effect and often have their detail smudged when it should be the other way around. Finally, some scenes don’t show noticeable difference when captured in Night mode. Night mode is great for brightening up a scene when it’s too dark, but otherwise, it doesn’t really work as well as Samsung would make you think.. Here are a couple of photos captured both in auto mode and in Night mode:. The ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s’ ultra-wide camera. It’s useful to capture a wider scene, but don’t expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it’s great if you love taking close-up shots, though it’s often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.. Here are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots.. For selfies, the Galaxy M31 has a 32MP camera and manages to take pleasing pictures outdoors. By default, you get 8MP photos, but you can switch to 32MP mode if you like to see more details in your selfies. At night, detail is lost whether it’s an 8MP photo or a 32MP photo, and you can also expect some camera shake if you don’t hold the phone steady using all the willpower you can muster.. In case you’re wondering, you can capture 4K videos with the front camera as well. Other camera features include Live Focus mode for bokeh shots with the front and rear cameras, which works pretty well most of the time (see some samples below). You can also capture Super Slow-mo and standard slow motion videos and create AR Emojis. Standard modes like Hyperlapse and Panorama are present as well.. Galaxy M31 performance. The Galaxy M31 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M30s, Galaxy A50s, and Galaxy A51. It’s the processor choice for Samsung’s budget and lower mid-range phones, and all I can say is that it gets the job done in day-to-day use. The M31 runs smoothly as long as you don’t try to switch apps and browse through the user interface too quickly. Apps mostly launch quickly, and since there’s 6GB of RAM on both the 64GB and 128GB storage variants, multitasking isn’t usually an issue.. Gaming performance is pretty good in titles like Call of Duty and PUBG, at least at the default graphics settings. The phone can stutter here and there when you initially load a game and start playing, but those stutters don’t show up after the first minute or two. It also didn’t have issues running well at the ultra frame rate setting in PUBG, and games like Asphalt 9 and Modern Combat 5 also run fine. This is something I also noticed on the Galaxy A50 and M30s – the Exynos 9610/9611 isn’t great for the general user interface, but its Mali-G72 MP3 GPU handles popular gaming titles very well.. Galaxy M31 software. Like every other Galaxy phone Samsung has launched in 2020, the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box. Well, it runs One UI Core 2.0, which is a stripped down version of One UI 2.0 that Samsung also brought to the Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M30 with the Android 10 update. You don’t get features like the built-in screen recorder or even something as basic as Secure Folder. Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini aren’t supported, either. Bixby is completely missing as well, except for Bixby Vision in the camera app.. And when I pressed Samsung about why the M series runs One UI Core even though devices like the M30s and M31 have the same processor as the Galaxy A51, which do get standard One UI 2.0 (though not with all features), I was told the company designs each phone according to the target market. But that doesn’t explain why stuff like Samsung Pay Mini and Secure Folder aren’t part of the package, and I can only assume Samsung wants to keep some features exclusive to costlier phones.. Since the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 out of the box, it will receive an update to Android 11 and Android 12 at some point. Android 11 might arrive quickly – the Galaxy M20 and M30 received the Android 10 update before the Galaxy Note 10 did, after all. Security updates are likely to come once every three months for the first two years, and whenever necessary from the third year onward.. Galaxy M31 battery life. With a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it’s no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won’t have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.. The M31 supports 15W fast charging. With such a big battery, faster charging speeds don’t matter that much, and given the price point Samsung is targeting with the M series, we probably won’t see the fast charging specification change any time soon. Still, it would be nice to have, as a full charge from 0 takes around two hours and a half. An hour of charging takes the charge to around 30 percent, though that 30 percent does last a considerable while.. Galaxy M31 audio and call quality. The M31 has a single bottom-firing loudspeaker that gets the job done if you’re in a small room but is too quiet to hear even at full volume otherwise. It’s the same story with every budget Galaxy phone, and the M31 doesn’t do anything to change that. Like the M30s’ speaker, the M31’s doesn’t distort at the highest volume, though, which is a plus. It could just do with a bit more depth in the low frequencies (bass).. For wired audio, you will need to opt for a third-party product as no earphones are bundled with the phone. When used with earphones from other budget/mid-range Galaxy smartphones, the M31 produces sound that is very heavy on the high frequencies (treble) but lacks punch in the lower frequencies. As for call quality, I noticed no issues with either of the two SIMs I was using, except for the fact that both the earpiece and the loudspeaker are on the quieter side and make it hard to hear what the person on the other end is saying.. Galaxy M31 verdict. The Galaxy M31 is more or less a Galaxy M30s with a macro camera, a higher-resolution main camera, more RAM on the base variant, and newer software out of the box. And the Galaxy M30s’ base variant, priced at Rs 12,999, is the better pick if you’re on an extremely tight budget. If you have Rs 14,999 lying around, then the Galaxy M31 offers excellent value for money. It would have been nice to see more feature-packed software, better quality from the 64MP rear camera in low light, and perhaps an Infinity-O display with smaller bezels, but for the asking price, these are all nitpicks that shouldn’t affect your decision to get the phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1637,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Balkrishan G.,Detailed Review...,"Personally as a user i am using this phone for past few weeks as surprisingly this phone is best value for money.. .. .. First of all the Display is best highlight of this phone obviously Samsung AMOLED are best in the market and this phone have that display,so no complaint for the display. It measures 159.2 mm x 75.1 mm x 8.9 mm and weighs 191 grams. The screen has a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 403 ppi pixel density. It has an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and screen-to-body ratio of 83.92 %.. .. .. Second. camera-the main sensor is 64mp Samsung ISOCELL Bright GW1 sensor along with an f/1.8 lens. The camera setup has also an 8-megapixel secondary sensor with an f/2.2 ultra-wide-angle lens that comes with a field of view (FoV) of 123 degrees -- alongside a 5-megapixel macro shooter that has an f/2.4 aperture and a 5-megapixel depth camera with an f/2.2 aperture. There is support for Live Focus for an enhanced bokeh effect. Samsung has also provided dedicated night mode, super steady mode, and super slo-mo (using interpolation).. You can record 4k at 30 fps. It has super steady mode for video recording which stabilize the video quite nicely.. It has a dedicated Night mode for the night shot too.. It Has 32mp selfie camera with AR doodle capabilities and also you can record slow motion video from the front camera.. Overall good Camera performance in this price range.. Third. Performance-Samsung has retained the Exynos 9611 SoC from the Galaxy M30s. This is an octa-core processor with four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. For graphics, it has the Mali-G72 GPU. You get 6GB of RAM and a choice between between a 64GB storage variant and a 128GB storage variant .. Directly if we talk about PUBG it can Handle HDR with Ultra FPS.. But prefer to play on HD at ULTRA FPS.. Overall this phone is truly made for Indians and the best point is that this phone is manufactured in india.. The Galaxy M31 has two Nano-SIM slots and has support for 4G as well as VoLTE. It also supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. Storage is expandable by up to 512GB.. On the software front, Samsung ships the new Galaxy M31 with OneUI 2.0 on top of Android 10. The software is similar to what we have seen on the recently launched Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy Note 10 Lite. We did find a fair amount of bloatware on Galaxy M31. Apart from the Google apps, Netflix, Facebook, Candy Crush Saga, and Samsung Max were preloaded on the smartphone. Samsung also has its own apps such as My Galaxy and Samsung Shop.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1638,Reviewed in India on 16 November 2020,Anonymouse,Works like a charm. Budget phone rocks.,"Using this phone for a year now. Never faced any problem.. Battery. The battery is super good and is the primary reason for buying this phone. It easily lasts 64 hours combined usage(18hrs screen on) for me from 100 to 0. My daily usage is mostly reddit and whatsapp so it will be less for heavy use. It is so easy for me to keep the phien between 30 to 70 pc extending its life further. Over last year of usage my batter y has only degraded from 5830 mah to 5050 mah.. Performance. Performance is quite good. Never saw it lagging in any day to day task. I don't game much on my phone but played a little of Genshin Impact before switching to PC and it worked only okay. I was getting around 25 fps in open world and 15 fps in combat with multiple enemies so make of it what you want. However to be fair, Genshin is the most demanding game in mobile and it will behave similarly for other phoen in this price(Don't quote me on that though).. Camera. I don't click photos so can't judge on that. Sorry.. Strength and durability. The backside gets dirty very easily. I have dropped the phone quite a many times(read twice a month) from my bed but no major scratch. I use a cheap 150rs screen protector and back cover for this so probably that saved it from the drop.. Miscellaneous. Fingerprint scanner is bad. Almost 30percent time it fails for me.. Face recognition is also little bit slow. However it recognizes in dark which is a good thing.. Physical buttons are good and sturdy. Mic works fine. Conclusion. I am impressed with this phone and would be using Samsung only when I replace this 3 years down the line. Honestly budget category for mobiles is so good that it doesn't make much sense to go above unless you are a gamer or a camera enthusiast. By the time you are reading this review this phoen would be obselete but I recommend these budget Samsung phones.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have used it for almost a year and overall have a positive feeling about it . The display is good , no complaints . Gorilla glass 3 has saved my phone to a certain extend. The processor used is decent for daily usage and some casual games. Coming to the camera , it is good in outdoor lighting and decent in indoor lighting conditions. The front camera however could have been better. The one UI is good and gives a nice experience. The battery gives me a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours with always on display on . May extend upto 10 hours sometimes. The speakers are loud enough but could have been slightly better though . Also I did not face much of connectivity issues .

1642,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,Prabhakaran Natraj,Review Of Samsung Galaxy M31,"Battery:-. The battery has a capacity of 6000mAh which sounds good and has fast charging (15w). But the problem that I face most of the time is that my phone gets heated up while it is on charging or even while I'm using the normal applications or gaming. The company claims that the battery can last upto two days after one time charging while you are not gaming or surfing for a long time. But again I face a problem here even when I'm using some of the common apps, sharing hotspot or gaming the battery lasts for about only 24hrs. In short the battery drains fast.. Performance :-. Performance wise the Samsung galaxy M31 is very good product. It does not hang or lag while gaming or using apps. The touch response is very good. I don't face problem's while using multiple apps at once and it does not have any problems while switching the apps and also while normal gaming. The fingerprint sensor located on the back of the phone also works quite fast in unlocking the device.. Camera:-. The camera quality is good. It has all the necessary requirement and amazing camera features like Pro camera, Panorama,Macro,Food, Night,Slow motion and Super slow motion videos and even Hyperlapse which is quite good features. We can use most of this features on the selfie camera mode aswell. There is also a problem that I face with the selfie camera that is the camera has a bit of yellowish appearance. Other than this all the other features are good.. Display:-. According to me the display of Samsung galaxy M31 is good. Because I have used quite all the types of phone's and I felt that the M31 has good quality of display compared to the phone's that I have used before.. Design:-. The design of the Samsung galaxy M31 is so beautiful. The smooth edges and the round corners which makes the phone comfortable to hold while taking selfies and while normal uses as well .

So, I have been using this for almost a month now and I would say this is really a great Smartphone.. 1) Camera quality and Clarity -- I would give 10/10. I have done a PhotoShoot of my Kid on his birthday with the phone and turned out really great pictures & it has many options for taking picture. 2) Battery life -- Generally I wont play Games or do any multimedia stuff, but I can say this has very good battery, I am getting 1 - 2 days for single Full charge (I may consider usage for at least 8hr a day). 3) Screen Clarity -- ""sAmoled screen"" really immersive Display ( you would feel the real view at night). 4) Fingerprint reader -- Unlocks with in no time, my old phone takes time to unlock but this reads very fast. Only negative that I could say is front camera (Not very impressive but OK)",5.0 out of 5 stars
1652,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,Ajayakumar,Best device under 19K.,"Overall its a good value for money device with a monstrous 6000 mAh battery 64 MP quad camera along with a 32 MP selfie camera. The Exynos 9611 SoC can handle most of the intense graphic games effortlessly. The OS does not load any ads unless the user chooses to. The privacy management is User centric where we can manage app data participate in marketing and advertisement etc.. .Users even can opt to receive ads the revenue from it is linked to users samsung account which can be donated to UN missions based on the users choice. This device (and most of M series devices) does not come with Knox security but still Samsung has provided many cryptographic modules and security applications to the device which makes it far more secure than other devices of same price segment.. That said, the device though having a powerful AI backed Camera, Does not come with a fully featured Pro mode users cant even control shutter speed. Samsung likely provide it in future updates.Also the OS is ONE UI 2.0 Core thus some premium Samsung features are not available. The night mode is awesome and the video mode has electronic image stabilization. Some features like internet speed indicator and screen recording are absent, but can be managed with 3rd party apps.The game launcher is amazing providing good optimization for games. The battery is good and one can easily manage to get a 9 hr screen on time even with mild gaming. The device comes with built in Dolby Atmos audio which gets activated when the headphone is plugged in, and along with SuperAmoled display it is perfect for binge watching. Also it is Wide-vine l1 certified for streaming.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1654,Reviewed in India on 14 August 2020,Rohit Upadhyay,"Impressive camera, display, and speed","Impressed with the camera and the screen. What I loved the most is M31's macro lens, it is impressive. The overall camera is great, 64 mp main camera gives amazing picture and the amoled screen shows the true colors, and the best part of camera is its pro mode, I can manage the ISO and white balance. The of of the phone is not that bas as it looks online, I really loved the design and back cover too, although, MI note 9 max pro looks better from behind.. And those who are worry about the speed, let me tell you, Samsung M31 is not going to upset you. I have used it for almost a week, and I didn't see any lags. It is fast, smooth, and I'm in love with the camera, colours, and screen.. However, there are a few things that can be upgraded. The first thing is, there is no light indicator for Charing. Another are, fingerprint sensor, if they had given it on on the power button, it will be a better option. Display is a bit narrow, it should have been a bit wide as per the size. And, what should be the must part is, there should be more options for natural colors mode. Vivid colors seem a bit harsh on red.. What I disliked is the battery and charging time. M31 takes really long time to charge, and battery drains so fast. It doesn't seem it has 6000 mah battery, however, from 10 to 40 percent it take less time to charge, but as it goes up, charging slows down.. Overall, it's quite a good option in this price segment, and can give a tough competition tk redmi, realme, vivo, and oppo.",4.0 out of 5 stars

First of all I would like to mention the battery back up. This phone saves me from carrying extra weight of power-bank. Fingerprint sensor is well responsive. There is no problem in reading under even direct sunlight. Amoled screen is excellent. Watching videos on this device is really great. Sound quality is superb. Dolby Atmos technology gives almost theatre like experience. External speaker is good. Rear camera quality is fine but front camera is not satisfactory. I can't give five out of five because of the performance of the front camera. Build quality meets my expectation.

The best thing is the battery seems like last for ever. One charge, and use it whole day with blue tooth and GPS ON, still at the end of the day, you will be left with 70% charge. That's huge. With 6000 mAH battery, the phone doesn't feel like heavy or bulky either. great.. Great screen quality, big screen, amazing cameras (total 5 cameras), huge RAM & Storage (6GB & 128 GB). Ticks all the right boxes. Can't ask for anything more at this price point.. Cons. Some minor bugs in the software. Knowing Samsung for long, normally they resolve all these bugs within first six months. So hoping the same with this one too.

1659,Reviewed in India on 19 August 2020,sarthak jasra,"Best ""Made in India"" phone","I have been using this phone for almost 50 days now.. Here's my Brief Review of My Galaxy M31:. 1. The Battery Life on screen time is about 11-12 hours and it can last till 1.5 days if you are a moderate user and a day if you are a heavy user.. 2. The Charging time to Charge this 6000 mah powerhouse is about 160 minutes.. 3. The Super Amoled screen display is supreme and delivers excellent video quality.. 4. The Camera also is quite nice and pixel quality is neat and, Front Facing Camera is Really Excellent, as per my experience.. 5. The Audio cellular quality is also appropriately nice and Speakers are loud enough to talk on video or audio calls without any Earphones too.. 6. The Processor needs to be improved in order to optimise the CPU, Battery and GPU Performance.. 7. The Security Updates are regular and would be monthly available for next 3 years as per Samsung.. 8. Fingerprint Scanner was also very fast and Face Unlock feature works pretty well too.. I would give this phone 8.5/10.. (1.5 points deducted for its exynos GPU and, Charger could have been 25-30 watts at this price point). Hope you all liked my Honest Review!. P.s: I am not a Gamer hence, i loved this phone..

Fastest Delivery by Amazon.. Fingerprint reader experience is awesome, reads quickly within microseconds.. 6000mAh battery is really the monster one.. Lasts longer and obviously it depends on mobile usage and the area of utilization(I.e. low network area will consume more battery) and environment (hot and cool).. Nice Camera... you have to set it to 64mp as it's set to 16mp in default setting.. 10x zoom is good feature.. Good image quality atLow lights.. Screen touch Experience is so good.. 6GB RAM and 128GB internal Memory.. Both Simcards can handle LTE Network..

1662,Reviewed in India on 24 December 2020,Saif Ali,Fails on promotional promise.,"After 4 months of continuous use:. Although I upgraded from my previous phone (the humble Redmi Note 5) but downgraded heavily on camera quality. Budget smartphone makers must understand that in the sub 15-20k range, the only aspect that can make them stand out from the sub 10-15k phones is the quality of camera, for the remaining features (the ones that really matter and have real utility for an average user) are available in the latter and perform just fine for the 1.5 - 2yr period (average user usually tends to move on to a different phone thereafter).. If the promotion is riding on quadruple cameras, promising quality output, deliverance on that front is imperative.. Don't buy if you're residual looking for a good camera phone.

1671,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2020,Harsh Suyal,Hangs and heats a lot,"Pointwise Review after 15 day usage:. Buid quality: Basic build quality with plastic uni-body, not that impressive but not that bad. Looks just fine. Back panel attracts lots of finger impressions.. Screen: must be the best displays that samsung is providing in M series within this price range or comparable to even flagships.. Rear camera: it has 4 rear camera sensors, here is what i felt about these:-. Main 64MP sensor: probably the best in this price range, performs phenomenonal in day light conditions. However, in low light conditions you start to feel that it's a lower mid rnge phone, though all phone in this price segment struggle in low light conditions.. Macro sensor: it fine, not bad. However, i had more expections with it.. Wide angle sensor: pathetic quality. Depth sensor: must be the worst, very poor edge detection.. Front camera: inclined towards good camera category, it can be improved.. Processor: no problem in normal usage, but not recommended for those who want to play heavy games on it.. Ram management: initially more than 3gb memory was always in use without software or even sim. But after tweeking the optimization settings and removing bloatware, it performing better. No complaint. Memory: it's fast, no complaint. Battery: it's really a monster. With normal usage of calling, camera, messaging you can easily get 2 days of battery life. It can be easily extended to even 4 days if you use very less.. Charging: Though samsung claims fast charging, it's not. 15W charger doesnt seems to be really providing 15W power. Theoretically, it should charge 6000mAh battery in 2 hours, but it takes 3-3.5 hours for full charging. Not that impressive.. Speaker output: it's fine, not that laud but not that low.. Sound quality in earphones: Good quality output, no complaint. Fingerprint and face unlock: no complaint. Cons:. 1. Slow charging speed. 2. Very poor wide angle camera. 3. Poor edge detection in depth camera sensor. 4. One serious problem that others also faced: randomly 2 times it got rebooted itself and stuck on boot screen for 20 minutes. I have to see if it persists.. Edit: after july OTA update battery performance reduced significantly.. Edit: after 1.5month of usage; working fine. Rebooting problem didnt happen again after OTA update. Battery performance was better before the update. However, still it's not bad. One need to tweek app settings to optimise the juice suckling of the apps.",1.0 out of 5 stars

This has perfect look which increases this phone's aesthetics. Lightweight which makes it easy to handle. When e comes over the display to is awesome. Large display. The fingerprint reader is pretty good to. The quality of the sensor I can feel it. Moreover the battery life. I charge my phone once a day . Which will last up to 22-23 hours. The only problem is the fast-charging. But I'm very satisfied with its performance. I can use 6000mh battery upto 23 hours and charges for 2 and a half hour. Now let's talk about the camera. Simply perfect. 64 mp main gives me perfect shots when need. While comes to wide-angle shot it makes difference in quality. But overall camera is good. Live-focus makes the photo live. Macro shots are awesome to. Quad camera is perfectly arranged to in this place. Strong flash to. It can also use as strong flashlight in the night. Wait I just forget to tell about camera options, Samsung provides more options like macro, pro, night, panaroma, slowmo, super-slowo, hyperlapse and food which gives you complete satisfaction. And budget is perfect. For a mid-range customer Samsung M31 is perfect and would be the best choice for you under 19,000. It is actually a monster!!!. King of mid-range phone's. Processors is not like other Samsung phones. M31 has less lag. Faster. Speakers are very loud and clear. Under 20,000 the best phone you can get when look to battery, processor, camera, and data your personal data security. You can trust Samsung. This trust gives us M31 the real monster in this range. No phones from other companies can compete with it in battery under this range. It is actually a MONSTER!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

1676,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Saugato Adhikary,"A review after months' usage, read it to know the truth behind this phone","I am writing this review after using the phone for a couple of months. Here is what I have to say.. 1. Battery:- The hype for this phone was about the battery and camera. This battery I would say will give you a day's time to do whatever you want. I have done heavy gaming, listened to music videos, called, surfed internet and still the battery longed for a full 24 hour. Some times more. So a good one, 4 stars.. 2. Camera :- A 64 megapixel back camera, along with 3 more cameras at the back for macro, wide angle and many more quality functions. I am pleased with the front camera as well. So a four star only because the 64 mega pixel could have been a bit more clear and effective. But I won't complain since I am not a photographer.. 3. Display :- Best in the market. Eyes closed, a five star, you won't get any better. Best cinematic experience ever.. 4. Audio :- I have heard people complaining about the audio being bit low, but I found the speakers to be quite loud and more importantly crystal clear. Samsung has given a built in Dolby atmos feature for ultimate audio experience when connected to earphones or bluetooth devices. It is just fantastic. A five star for overall audio experience.. 5 :- Processor and phone speed :- It is all good, nice speed while gaming in medium graphics, and using multiple apps, works just fine except a couple of times I have faced genuine lag while using the keyboard. The default keyboard, the phone just stops for a minute, and I have to lock it and unlock it again to make it work. I was sad to see that, hoping it is a keyboard issue and not a processor issue. Otherwise an overall 3.5 stars for the speed.. Overall it is a ideal phone to buy within the range as you would never get such artistic amoled display, and audio, with a great battery life and medium phone speed.. So go ahead. Get yourself a Samsung M31 now!",4.0 out of 5 stars

1679,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2020,Akhila r.,Samsung m31,"a) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.. b) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.. c) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.. d) Fingerprint Scanner is good .. e) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.. f) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.. I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme etc",5.0 out of 5 stars

Thank you Samsung.,"The phone is amazing as its band name said it self i.e. "" SAMSUNG "". Camera quality Amazing... Sounds quality also very good and touch, fingerprint sensor, face recognition and other services are too good.. One thing which i most like is "" Super Amoled Display""... Too...too... good ... and no harm for our eyes.. Some functions which i dislike is that too least option for gesture and motion.Also No notification light...it provides sound instead of notification light..but i don't like it. Also you don't provide a earphone. I want the Samsung Earphone for its too good sound quality. Some app in my phone doesn't work properly like WhatsApp..message couldn't send immediately... take a too long time.. i know that it will be a network problem... but i check it properly... no network problem.. also chrome not updated if i want to update it..other google app update but chrome doesn't.. So i don't like it.... Any other functions for data saving ... Amazing.. Camera Result Amazing...no words for describe it... All over the phone is too much better than others.. If I compare this phone with other it is too Good phone.... All over i gave a rating to this phone is 4.5 star.. Thank you GalaxyM31. Thank you Amazon. Thank you Samsung being a part of my life.

Battery life is just stunning. Performance is very good. The amoled display with the dark mode looks very astonishing.. An issue which i noted was with the pop up and split screen. Usually it just works fine but if the phone gets heated due to multi tasking and prolonged use then you can't see the pop up view or split screen for any application. I think this maybe a bug with the one ui 2.0 which will be corrected in future updates. You'll get to see pop up view and split screen options within 10 to 15 mins if the phone is idle.

I would have thrown it away if i use it one day, fortunately my wife is using it and she got some extra patience. I bought this after seeing the good reviews, So i assume that this is not the case for all. But the piece i got cannot be used anymore. It is found that it is hanging when I open any application, but most case when we open the camera. (just adding that the camera quality is extremely good).

Gaming experience is really quite fantabulous and sampled display is also quite good. Sound quality is not the best in class but quite good. Only drawbacks are you could feel the phone getting heated up after gaming (mostly when playing heavy games like PUBG Mobile or COD) and the device feels a bit heavy in hand. Overall the build quality is fantastic with a super fast physical fingerprint scanner and the quad-camera system performs quite well in daylight and the focus is also brilliant (both back and front camera). Again it's not the best for night captures yet you can't say it's bad. The 6000 Mah battery doesn't feel like it's one though lasts all day if you aren't that a heavy user.

I appreciate Amazon service immediately they delivered us a new phone using since a month not an issue. But please be cautous while ordering Samsung phones. As per my exp they are not as reliable as other phones. It only depends on your luck of getting good phone. Samsung can learn from MI how to build reliable and durable phone. Everyone spend their hard earned money not to buy some inferior quality product. Because of border tension do not mis use the opportunity. Otherwise you also will be thrown out of India..

1695,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Krishnaprasad,Monstrous 😍❤️💥,"Awesome Cameras- Perfect companion for all your photography needs. All the 4 cameras has got terrific skills to bring up exotic pictures.. Great Battery life- Expect upto 1.5 days of battery life if you are a casual user but do note that as this phone only supports 15W fast charging it would take around 3hrs to fully charge the device from 0-100.. Super Amoled display gives an exotic viewing experience as usual found in Samsung phones. Great memory management which easily handles the apps in the background without being killed.. The One UI 2.0 makes it a clean and cool gadget.. Concluding I would like to say that if you are looking for a smartphone with Great Cameras, Battery life, display then the Samsung Galaxy M31 is made for you.. I can say it's the safest android phone at the price point where it comes with no bloatwares or ads in unlike the Chinese mobile brands.. Like the name suggests it's a Monster in Camera, Battery & Display.. It's also light weight when compared though it has got a massive 6000Mah battery..

1696,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Divyanshu Saxena,An awesome phone for professionals,"An awesome phone, with an absolutely excellent display and UI.. Pros. - Best display in range (and even beyond). The super Amoled display not only provides a vibrant display but also provides great viewing angles and the colors on the screen really come out well. Plus, the Always on display is a unique and impressive feature though not much useful.. - Samsung's OneUI is a pleasure to use. Lots of features, easy management of apps and notifications. Adding to that, Android 10 experience is also really good.. - Battery life is much more than sufficient. Even after heavy usage and extensive video/audio playing, it lasts a bit more than a day. It sure does take some time to charge but that's worth the wait as the phone lasts for about two days with normal use and one complete day with heavy usage.. - Camera clarity is good and provides a lot of modes, for shooting stills and videos.. - Non-Chinese brand :'). Cons. - Not the fastest charger in the segment.. - The back panel is plastic, which does not look as premium as other phones in the price segment, but since I use a back cover anyway it doesn't matter much.. - I don't do much gaming but from other reviews, it seems it doesn't perform as good.. - That's pretty much it.. Go for it. A great phone for working professionals who aren't into gaming and need their phone for texting, content watching and basic management tasks.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Utterly bad camera. The only feature worth the money is the battery, which can run days on ultra mode. The internal memory is 128 gb, it's fine. But the RAM, I expected to have smooth run. But of the 6 gb RAM, the internal bloatware apps and system always occupy mostly 3 to 3.5 gb. It's very disappointing. And I bought this for the 64 mp camera. It's worst than my MI note 3 with 12 mp. When you zoom, the camera fails and gives very mediocre picture quality. Worst, we cannot zoom in the 64 mp mode, cmon. What for the 64 mp. It's not a monster but a mere failure. The macro works in daylights. So, if your money is precious, and if your aim is to buy a 64 mp camera, 6gb ram, the M31 will be a failure. Very poor 64mp camera, very poor RAM.

1713,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,Nikhil Badekar,Real monster as it's named.,"Performance of the phone is nice, camera quality is also great, but pictures are artificially blured, thought it has nice detailing. Supersteady mode in this camera is awesome , it also has electronic stabilization upto 1080p resolution no stabilization is provided to 4k recording. Having a massive Battery life of 6000mah, which lasts upto 9 to 10 hrs of continue use. Super amoled display gives a good vivid view and gives you best experience to watch movies or playing games. Playing pubg in high graphics gives lags and frame drops but in smooth graphics it's nice, you can play in extreme frame rate that's 60fps. It also have inbuilt game booster which also supports screen recording only for the games apps. After updating phone which has arrived on 25 July phone is heating and while charging and playing games or by doing multitasking. Ram is so powerful that even if you run all the apps in background it doesn't reloads it, I have 8gb variant that's enough for heavy multitasking like playing games, video editing software and also social media apps. Back of phone is having a plastic body which gets dirty by using without back cover, finger Print marks appears after some use and also it gets scratches on it easily. Overall design is nice fits into hands comfortably. Since Samsung has to work on update and fix the heating problem.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1714,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2020,Ishwariya P,Mega Monster at 15k price range.....,"Pros. 1. Excellent sAmoled display with stunning camera stills. 2. Superb battery backup with 6000 mah. 3. Blue light protector can be enabled to protect our eyes from harmful blue Rays emerge out of phones. 4. Average processor but ok. 5. Definitely a monster at this price range. Cons. 1. Mobile gets heated up bit while using camera and other apps continously. Also, during software update. 2. Full Mobile charging 1%-100% takes up to 2.5hrs for full charging as the charger is15w fast charger and not 25w charging like in other phones.. Overall rating 4 and 1 star less for above cons..

Now, the picture is getting clearer by the day, as to how Samsung is providing such higher configuration at a nominal price. Indians are being cheated openly in a broad day light.. If you are going with the brand name (Samsung), then, believe me you definitely will feel cheated. Except the display, it has nothing more to cheer for. The battery (6000mAh) is much hyped, on continuous usage it drains at a much faster pace. Many a times, its screen freezes and does not allow any action. If you are scrolling the screen, while on some app, it doesn't goes that smoothly and gives an impression as if the screen is freezing for decisecond.. Think twice before wasting your time and resources on Samsung products. Always better to go with some other reliable brands.",1.0 out of 5 stars

QUICK feedback i can share is phone is good it’s for my mother i felt its bit heavy compare to my S10+. its really heavy i think because of battery.. 1. Screen is dam good i liked it videos & picture are good i rate 5.. 2. Some review said sound not good, but i like the sound its very good nice clarity & you get stereo effect. 3. Battery life is good at present. NOT LIKED:. 1. Buttons side and frame colour are same its bit hard to find it, they could have done bit better.. 2. Phone is heavy. IMPROVMENT OR FEEDBACK TO SAMSUNG:. 1. Charge for accessories customer will pay. Like screen guard, cover, earphone etc. when they opt this it must get added in the box. Since it will be company manufactured it will suit the phone else we need to run around local shop with local manufacture were we see lots of issue.. 2.

1721,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2020,Harsh raj,This smartphone solves the prime problems of a smartphone user.,The product is good ....but one need to be careful while starting the phone first time becz ....there is lot of hidden option available which disables lots of unwanted ads while accepting the terms and conditions and we indian have a habit of blindly accepting all the terms and conditions without exploring it. So please read the terms and conditions carefully and avoid giving randoms permission everywhere which will help you enjoy your phone..more seamlessly.. The camera is quality is quiet good if it we compare it with other smartphones of same price range. The battery life is also good....however i do believe that the power adapter of 15W is not that sufficient to charge the phone...it usually takes 2.5 to 3 hours to complete charge the phone..

1722,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,Deepak Mahesh,It's good in it's on way.,"The phone has am amazing battery life, and best in class camera. The display is pretty great for the price. The contrast and colors you get from the FHD+ display is greate. The other thing the Samsung improved from the past phone is its software. The One UI is one of my favourite android UI right now. It is simpler and well organized and easy to use and has many handy features when you need it. The UI is designed such that the buttons on top are brought lower to the screen for easy access. It comes with a 15W charger which is pretty cool.. The things that hold the phone back is its processor. Its slower when compared to its competition, so a smoother gaming is not it's strength (but performes decently during other tasks like opening multiple medium load apps). The back cover is made of plastic which looks like glass so it doesn't break easily, which is kind of a good thing but it looks less sleek because of that. But I am going to put a cover on it any way. So it doesn't matter much to me. This phone is more of a media machine rather than a gaming phone. So this phone is more preferred for people who watch a lot of videos, surfs the web and plays music, kaes a lot of photos with their phone and takes calls. (The audio quality during call is pretty good.)",4.0 out of 5 stars

Really good Camera quality. There are 4 cameras and the primary one is 64 Mp.. It also has slo mo and Bokeh features. Moreover it has a digital motion stabilization while recording video which means that slight wobbles and shaking won't come in the camera and the video would look cleaner.. 2. Battery: It has a 6000mAh battery. It always lasts around 2 days if you use the phone above moderate level. If you don't use your phone much, it will last way more than that.. 3. Performance: It was overall very smooth. Didn't lag at all during my use. Since it had 6gb ram it worked really smooth. Would Highly recommend if you want good performance.. 4. Display: The sAmoled display was really good. It has a really clear display. Moreover it has gorilla glass 3.0. 5. Speakers : The speakers in the phone are really good. It has good sound quality.. 6.Wifi calling : It has the wifi calling feature which works well with my jio sim.. 7. Dedicated micro sd card slot. It has dual sim and a dedicated micro sd card slot.. 8. The phone is slightly heavy which makes it easy to hold .. 9. it has fast charge feature. Cons.. 1: The fingerprint sensor is not very fast. But still reasonably fast.. 2. Camera has a lot of options that make it slightly complicated. The 64 Mp mode won't be turned on initially so you will have to switch to it if you want. In the 64 M.P mode zooming is not there also it is in 3:4 aspect ratio. It's ok since you can crop it later. Also in night the picture quality won't be that good.. 3. Lack of I.R blaster is not much of a con. 4. Headphones are not included in the package.. 5. The charging time is around 2 hrs.. Overall it's a really good option for the price. The pictures taken by the camera may look like it was taken from a DSLR. No lags and really smooth. Highly recommended for this price.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1742,Reviewed in India on 15 June 2020,Ketakee Mahajan,Samsung galaxy M31,"There are some definite plus points about this phone:. 1. The BATTERY: Yeah, it's that big! The 6000mAh beast goes on for more than a whole day despite the continuous usage of internet (including Facebook, YouTube, Netflix etc.) Also, if you restrain from using the phone heavily while it's charging, the battery percentage goes from 20 to 100 within two hours.. 2. Camera: The 64 MP camera catches the details really well, although excess zooming may make the pictures appear pixelated.. The wide angle lens gives a 123° view and sticks to the claims made. The main 64 MP camera has an autofocus, but allows manual focussing too.. Macro 5 MP cam is a little disappointing as it captures unsatisfactory images in low light, but otherwise gives some great close-up shots.. 3. Processor: One needs to remember to do the software update once the phone is active. If not done so, you will certainly face lags even within the same app, not just while switching between different apps. Once that update is done, the phone runs ever so smoothly.. P.S. I'm not a video game player, so wouldn't know anything about the speed of those operations.. 4. Space: There's no particular need, but 128gb basic ROM is more than sufficient to incorporate all your favourite music, small video clips as well as movie files in . mp4 or .avi formats.. 5. Fingerprint reader: You HAVE to cover the complete scanner area. Thankfully, the phone gives suggestions like ""cover the whole scanner"" and ""wipe off the water droplets"".. The phone doesn't heat up much during charging, just gets a little warm and that seems normal.. Overall, if you're looking for a budget phone with good specifications that's made in India, you wouldn't regret buying this model.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1761,Reviewed in India on 3 July 2020,Ashwini Kumar Singh,ALMOST PERFECT IN THIS PRICE RANGE.,"In overall aspects the phone is 95% perfect( 100% perfect if you have no problem with slow charging).. I have used a similar mobile REDMI NOTE 8 PRO. And I can tell that this 64MP camera is GREAT. The pictures are sharp and clear.. Touch screen and display are AMAZING.. Fingerprint sensor works perfectly.. When I received the phone, it was 53% charged. I used it till 16% for 7.5hrs before putting it on charge. So the battery looks great. But,. while writing this review, it's been 2 hrs since charging and it has still reached 80%. So it's charging slow, like really slow. Comparing it to Redmi note 8 pro, it's taking too much time to charge. It's not charging like a fast charger.. On other aspects, it's 10/10 including battery life.. The only issue is charging. I talked to Samsung, they told you can use a 25W charger if you need. So let's see.. P.S- If you are looking for a good non-chinese phone, then this is it.( Or other phones of Samsung Galaxy M-series). Edit: After using for more than one day,the battery doesn't seem like a real 6000mAh. It's not lasting long like a 6000mAh battery. I'd say it's more like a good 4500mAh battery.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1788,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,Rohan Siddhu,For this price I think that it's a great choice.,"This product is awesome. Super budget friendly, super powerful mobile phone.. Pros:-. Battery life:. Under normal use it lasts whole day.. Memory:. Ample amount of RAM, i.e., 6GB. Processor:. It has a very powerful processor, its a 10nm design, and it powerful than any snapdragon processor at this price.. Display:. Obviously, when it comes to displays nobody does it better than Samsung.. Camera:. It's a 64 MP quad camera setup which is very impressive and new high efficiency format use less storage.. Biometrics:. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock features work quite fast.. Cons:-. Weight:. It's a bit heavy but for 6000mAh battery this is obvious.. Speaker:. I've compadre Galaxy A50s and this phone's speakers side by side but A50s is better. M31 is cheaper so can't complain but they could have given better speakers.. Doesn't support Samsung Secure folder.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1789,Reviewed in India on 5 September 2020,Rajan kumar mandal,Pros and cons of buying Samsung Galaxy M31,The most and amazing thing in this Samsung galaxy M31 is this has Great superior camera quality all modes have a great and unique features also the battery life is amazingly can last upto 2 days after playing 4 movies back to back listening music back 2back 8 hrs till now in this budget no phone can give this battery life.And the fingerprint reader sensor is great it works in fraction of second.. However only one thing that is missing in this phone for which Samsung is most smart company that is BIXBY I missed a lot using this phone like my all others Samsung galaxy A51S A50 and s9+ has .if samsung would give an update in which Bixby will be included.Trust me I can buy this phone for my full family including all 18 members.,5.0 out of 5 stars
1790,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Ankit,"A must buy, Non Chinese company product in this price range","Giving this review after 4 days of use. I was the ios user but now I am realizing that spending too much on phones which people used to change in around two years is a waste of money. Hence shifted to Android (Galaxy M31).. Firstly I was thinking about Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, but since it is a product of Chinese Company, so stooped there only. Too much Patriotism :).. Pros-. - The phone looks beautiful.. - The display is awesome, played some 4k videos from youtube. Screen quality is really awesome. It also has Blue light filter functionality. You can schedule the same as per your need.. - The overall performance is good. No heating. Played general games (NFS etc) and it worked really well. - 6000 Mah battery is really big enough for me (comparing with iPhones). Lasts for almost 1.5 Days with general use.. - 64 GB storage is sufficient and you can expand it to 512 GB with an external card.. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE. - Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone. The phone came with a 30% charge. Charged fast.. - The camera is good. The macro camera works perfectly fine. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.. Since I am not a photographer, this is more than enough for me.. - Fingerprint and Face recognition is good (Don't want to compare with apple.). Cons -. - The phone is a little heavy and not slim (But it doesn't look bulky, it really looks awesome). - There were some claims that it takes 160 minutes to charge from 0-100% which is wrong. This phone takes around 3.50 hours for full (0-100) recharge.. - There is no earpiece provided by Samsung.. Overall this Phone is really a must buy in this price range. Don't go with negative reviews.. I have seen some reviews where people are saying the camera is not good. It is not justifiable to compare its camera with DSLR or any other high-end phones (For example iPhone 11) as. Your DSLR can not make calls and much more other things what this phone can. and Other high-end phones like iPhone 11 don't come in 16000 Rs.. The camera quality is really good and you can go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1793,Reviewed in India on 11 October 2020,Arunima Sharma,A gamble to buy !,"Disappointed with the model, It has some problem in the hardware as charging pattern is non uniform. After 5- 6 days of buying i noticed my phone is getting charged very slowly, it took about 12 hours to charge it 50%. This happened 3-4 days. After that charging speed use to increase day by day.Now its getting charged 1% in 1 min.which is fine. But i could not get why my phone was not getting charged properly in the initial days.. The second issue with my set is with the microphone, it also gets fail to show consistent good voice quality. My voice to the other end gets slow anytime.. Even many of my friends got sets with different issues ( like corrupt display and phone do mot getting switched on ). Camera is pretty nice, the strength of Samsung sets.. However, based on such points i will not recommend anyone to buy this.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1794,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2020,Amazon Customer,Great phone in the Budget phone Segment minus the old Processor,I was looking for a budget phone with a decent battery and camera.. Samsung M31 seemed to fit in that category perfectly.. Pros. 1) A gigantic battery of 6000mah with a 15v quick charging option. Gives you so much relaxation when you are using multiple things through the day. Have sailed through a day without battery charging.. 2) The Live focus feature on the camera works pretty well for the price it is being offered.. 3) Great captures with minute detail capturing under ample light. I am yet to use it under low light.. 4) Pretty lightweight for a phone with such huge battery size. 5) Two Sim card slots plus a memory card slot over and above the 128 GB storage is a bonus. 6) A secretly hid Dolby Atmos feature which adds quite an impact on the sound when on bluetooth or earphone. Cons. 1) A very outdated processor which doesn't do justice to the 6GB Ram being offered. The functioning is quite okay. 2) Need to really work on the Face Unlock technology. I had to stop using face unlock on the second day because I was tired of so many disapproval from my phone. 3) Once you disconnect the call there is a 2 second lag for the call screen to go away which gets pretty annoying.. 4) Lot of redundant apps being given with the phone and loads of unwanted samsung apps attached which doesn't add value to your functions.. 5) Plastic body with multiple hand prints if being used with a cover.. Overall If you are looking for a budget phone with amazing camera and battery this is your phone. But if you are too much into gaming configuration it is not going to entice you much.,4.0 out of 5 stars

1796,Reviewed in India on 1 June 2020,Neha,Nice Phone at a great price,"I'm reviewing this phone after 3 weeks of usage. The phone is good if you are using it for normal usage. The 6000 mah battery can give you more than 24+ hrs if you just listen to music, use social media, and click pictures. here are the pros and cons:. Pros:. 1) Big Battery: can give 1+ days using medium usage and 30+ hours if it's very light usage. 2) Nice display: sAmoled display is great and its the best in this price range. 3) Daylight photography nice: the colors are very accurate.. 4) Nice sound: it has a single speaker but the sound quality is nice. 5) The UI i.e One UI 2.0 is very clean and nice to use.. Cons:. 1) Uses Exynos 9611 chipset which is not best when compare to snapdragon 712 or MediaTek G90t.. 2) Camera2api is limited you don't get level 3 support so no Gcam available. 3) The stock camera is nice for daylight photography the colors are nice but during the night the quality is very bad the night mode does not work as well as it is supposed to do. Samsung can improve this is the upcoming update if they want its just a software issue.. 4) The updates are very less in Samsung smartphones. The phone is having a February security Patch. This can also improve the security patch updates can be frequent.. 5) One more con is the details in the photos are missing due to the aggressive noise cancellation algorithm used by Samsung./when you zoom into photographs the details are missing. But in 64mb mode the details are present but it can also be done in 16 MB photo also.. 6) The battery takes approx 3 hrs to charge in spite of fast charging which is only 15 watt i.e adaptive fast charging as it is called by Samsung. If you use are charger having more than 15 watts rating it will still only take 15 watts of power from that charger. Samsung must allow the usage of more than 15-watt charger via software update if possible because to charge such a big battery in less time at least 30-watt charging should be allowed. Conclusion: if you are not a gamer and use your phone just to listen to music, click pictures, and use Facebook, Instagram, etc then this is the phone for you. You get a Samsung brand phone for such a price point with sAmoled display 64 MB camera, nice audio. There are some issues related to camera which can be fixed via updates like full camera2api support, improved night mode, and so little camera improvements and the frequent security updates should be provided.. Overall: 8.5/10. Camera: 8/10. Sound: 9/10. Display: 10/10. Performance: 9/10. Battery: 10/10",4.0 out of 5 stars
1797,Reviewed in India on 7 November 2020,Yusuf Ahmad,"Super Battery life, Amazing performance, Unbelievable Sound Quality","Battery life and speed is simply amazing, though I have not used for gaming. First Time I am hearing such forceful and clear Sound quality in any mobile,. I feel its better than even my laptop's sound quality. Dolby Atmos settings allow to further refine the sound quality. Screen resolution and brightness are good and color saturation can be adjusted through its few color mode presets in settings. Body/Build is quite strong. Phone MIc is clearly better and more sensitive than what I notice with my headset mic.. Allows two nano sims in 4G, and data can be selected though either sims and a setting is there to allow net use during calls. A separate slot is there for SD card..

Cons:. 1) Phone heats up quickly while charging and when used continuously for above 30-35 mins. 2) The touch could have been a little more smoother i.e. Less resistive. 3) User Interface is quite complex, took 2-3 days to completely get aquanted with it",3.0 out of 5 stars

Awesome Camera Quality...(you can see images on my Instagram page nature_diary2020). my favourite one is Macro Mode. Better than iPhone 8 which I was using previously, and One Plus 5.... 2. Battery life is just wow..with a full charge battery lasts up to 1 and a half day with high usage.... 3. Still, I haven't faced any lag or hanging issues.... 4. Screen resolution is good.. Cons:. 1. The body is plastic which could have been better(metal).. 2. Charging time is approx 5 hours for 0 to 100% charging, I prefer charging overnight which matches its requirement. Charging cable is very small which I understood is required for charging 6000 mah battery faster.. 3. It feels heavy on your hand after holding one plus 5 it feels like you are holding a brick.. 4. There's no headphone provided with the phone.so you need to buy a headphone additionally.. Conclusion: I am a tech-savvy person and I do travel a lot. this phone fits into all my requirements with great camera, good battery life and a lot more. After 4 months and a few days of usage, I haven't faced any issues with this phone apart from its charging time which is approx 5 hrs and keeps the juice up for one and half day.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1807,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Sharath Krishna ,Best phone for 16k (128gb),"The phone is really awesome and worth to spend 16k on. It is very handy, looks nice (back should have been given some gradient design), and very light weight. Operation is very smooth. It is so user friendly that it assists searches, it has settings for almost everything you see on the phone which means you need not compromise with how it asssits you. The best thing I liked is its focus mode which is a must have in any student's phone...also we can create our own mode where we can decide which all applications we must be able to use while having a me time.6 gb + 128 gb is too much to get for 16k from such a reputed brand like samsung. I have been using this phone for past 3 days and it has not made me disappointed. This phone is made for normal users where all your needs are met. Voice quality is good on call, speakers are not so loud,battery backup is awesome with 6000 mah. Options to delete screenshots after sharing was another awesome feature. My gallery used to be flooded with unwanted screenshots and now its solved. Its size is also good. Enough for reading pdfs and watching movies and won't hurt your thumb after long use. I have a suggestion that the pack could have included a back cover also as most of midrange phones comes with backcover with it. Battery takes about 2 and a half hours to get fully charged from nearly 0. Phone comes with android 10. Photos taken are okay. I'm not a photography person. I'm really happy with my choice...

1814,Reviewed in India on 28 May 2020,Hemanthkumar,My Experience with Samsung Galaxy M31,"At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.. Pick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.. When you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.. The Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.. Samsung Galaxy M31 specifications and features. The spec sheet of the Galaxy M31 looks similar to that of the Galaxy M30s. It sports a 6.4-inch AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution. It also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection which should keep it from picking up scratches too easily. The display has good viewing angles and is legible when outdoors. There are two colour profiles to choose from, and you can also change the white balance.. Samsung has retained the Exynos 9611 SoC from the Galaxy M30s. This is an octa-core processor with four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. For graphics, it has the Mali-G72 GPU. You get 6GB of RAM and a choice between a 64GB storage variant and a 128GB storage variant for Rs. 15,999 or Rs. 16,999 respectively. However, Samsung is offering a Rs. 1,000 discount which brings the prices down to Rs. 14,999 and Rs. 15,999 respectively. The duration of this offer has not been specified.. Samsung has bumped up RAM on the Galaxy M31 compared to its predecessor which should give it some leverage while multitasking. We did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again.. The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. We enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which should let you stream full-HD content.. We ran our usual benchmarks on the Galaxy M31. In AnTuTu, it managed to score 191,981 points which are higher than the Galaxy M30s did. The Galaxy M31 also scored 348 and 1,247 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests. As for graphics benchmarks, the Galaxy M31 managed 41fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 8.9fps in GFXBench Car Chase",5.0 out of 5 stars

And not having good camera and battery taking too much time to charge eventhough 15w charger around 4 hours, not retrieving network from sim and network lagging issue. Overall amazon is not helping for customers just skipping the issues. Completely you will not satisfy with amazon if you have any mobile issue after delivery.",1.0 out of 5 stars

1817,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2020,Anupam,Best midrange phone with packed features,After using over 6 months. Dislikes: the camera does not produces decent picture and degrading further.. The battery now only stays for a day with normal usage so similar to other phones. Not seeing any big value with 6000mah. Earlier review on first week of usage.. Likes : The phone looks stunning and packs great features. The best part 6000 MaH battery which never feels bulky as the weight is balanced so nicely. The phone comes with all positive features in good price point. The UI is easy to use and no useless preinstalled apps like Realme phones. It makes all sense to buy this device with name tag Samsung.. Dislikes: The camera could have been better. The back panel gets scratches easily during daily use and finger prints are easily noticeable. But this might be the case with most of the phones in this price range.. Conclusion : The phone is just a basic handset and cannot be used for long time like 2 or 3 years. The back of phone needs cover from first day else you end up with scratches and discoloration. It's not a great handset as it claims.,5.0 out of 5 stars
1818,Reviewed in India on 5 June 2020,Nitish bhardwaj,This Phones is a complete Package for Tech Geeks,"The GALAXY M31 has been in my consideration since its launch as it created buzz prelaunch due to its features. This product is being projected as the leader in this segment. Now come to the real and first experience, this phone has delivered upon its feature. The Camera quality is amazingly better than other phones who are selling themselves on camera feature. The picture quality with real colors, several modes of photography proves its claim about the camera quality. The video shooting is also better as compare to the ""Camera Phones.. The second feature which is very outstanding,despite speculation, is Battery capacity, performance and life. The Battery runs long(upto 20 hours) while using internet,Netflix or whatever OTT. The battery life also enhances Gaming and phone experience. The best thing, battery of such big capacity doesn't make it hot while using full features. The accessibility and control are impeccably good. There is no lag while using or locking-unlocking. The fingerprint reader is also of higher quality. It performs way way better than other phones of this segment. Other features like screen resolution, touch also gives you more value for money. Overall this phone by Samsung in this price is a Big thumbs up, you'll have a good experience while using GALAXY M31.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1819,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,Govind B.,Overall A great budget  phone,I purchased this phone 2 months ago. Condition of phone after 2 months is very good. Camera is too good of phone worth to purchase. But the fingerprint scanner is not so good it take little bit more time to unlock the phone. Talking about battery ...the battery is superb .. in starting 1 month I play pubg in this phone in HDR mode. Without lagging &low heat up of phone only 20 to 25%battery reduce after 2 to 2.5 hour of gameplay. Other functions are great but samsung doing so much price cut by not giving earphone or back cover with the phone. Talking about charging it don't take so much time even with 6k MaH battery but yes the charger with m31s must be with this phone too. Sharing some picture clicked with my phone.....,5.0 out of 5 stars
1820,Reviewed in India on 27 May 2020,ASHISH,Samsung M31 latest smartphone you must buy!!,"Samsung recently introduced its latest smartphone in the M-series with the launch of Galaxy M31. The smartphone comes with a host of interesting features and it is priced at Rs 14,999 for 6GB RAM + 64GB storage and Rs 15,999 for 6GB RAM + 128GB storage variant. .  . The latest smartphone from Samsung is loaded with a powerful 6,000mAh battery along with improved cameras and sleek design. So, is it enough to compete against the likes of Poco X2 and Realme 6? Let’s find out. . Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option. . Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos. .  . Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review.  . The Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture. .  . That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos..  In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements. . Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review.  . The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent. .  . Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas. .  Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review.  The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions. .  . On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1822,Reviewed in India on 27 May 2020,Rahul Sethi,A Perfect buy in this price segment.,"Writing this review after using this phone for more than a month as my primary device.. Not less than a Flagship phone at a very comfortably affordable budget. Slim, light weight and attractive desgine. Premium to hold and use. The screen is amazing and produces amazing colours.. Pros :. 1. First of all amazing 64 megapixel camera shoots amazing and highly detailed pictures with amazing colours.. ultra wide angle camera of 8 megapixel is too good for landscape and nature photography.. 5 Mp Macro-camera and 5 Mp depth camera adds a special touch to this quad canera device... Front facing 32 Mp camera captures the true skin colour in almost every situations.. The most amazing feature is its night camera which captures images better or almost equal to some professional cameras.. It also offers 4k video and slo-mo on both i.e. front and rear camera and ultra slo-mo on back camera.. 2. 6000 mah battery is more than enough and lasts almost around 26-27 hours approx (am not a gamer or a heavy user but ""always on display"" is continuously on.). 3. Amazing sound, loud, crisp and clear. Clear voice on calls.. 4. No heating problem while on charge or on call or while surfing internet for longer hours.. 5. Nice on screen animation and colour reproduction.. Cons :. 1. The thing which matters the most is there are not much options in the PRO MODE.. 2. The keyboard lags a little bit and takes around 2 minutes to resume back.. 3. If you turn on the speakers while on call, you won't be able to hear anything the other person is saying from the other side.. 4. When you creat folders on the app screen and add apps on it, the apps would come out every time you restart the phone.. 5. There could have been more features in the phone as compared to other brands in this price segment like locks and security, dual apps, IR Blasters etc etc.. Overall am quite satisfied with this smartphone as i wanted a camera centric phone with a large battery and this is absolutely that device.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Pros: Camera, SAMOLED screen, battery. Cons: Touch sometimes is too sensitive, some bugs are there like network connectivity is poor, phone getting auto locked due to feature like accidental touch protection.

1824,Reviewed in India on 10 June 2020,Aniruddh sinh Jadav,Stop having second thoughts,"What a fabulous decvice..... I was a little sceptical about purchasing this phone as i saw some bad reviews, but trust me those people i think don't know how to use phone properly.... Pros. ........... The Mesmerizing display, it can easily beat the display of any phone in this price eg. Poco x2, redmi note 9 pro etc..... The battery is just great, last for 1 and half days, and some people are saying charging time is more than 3 hrs, thats not true, it charges in roughly 2 to 2 and a half hour.. One UI 2.0 is the most beautiful UI , you cannot even compare it with MiUI or any other ui, since its Ad free and just so easy to use.. The camera is beast in this one with soooo many features. No complaints there.. The processor is also really good, handles all day to day tasks plus games like pubg pretty easily, if you play pubg for 1 hour , it will drain only 10 to 12 % of battery.. ............ Cons. ........... Only thing i didn't really like is that its not a slim phone, if you get a case and toughened glass, it gets pretty thick.. If you are okay with that like me...then don't think much just go for it. 😍",5.0 out of 5 stars
1825,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Amazon Customer,Great deal for this price range,"Purchased this Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) from amazon on 8h March 2020. After using 3 months here is my review.. First impression: Value for Money. Great phone for the price range of 15k.. Proc:. 1) M31 already use Android 10.0 as factory default operating system. This OS has been installed together with Samsung user interface ONE UI 2.. 2) four-camera at back side body with 64 MP f/1.8 for standard + 8 MP f/2.2 for ultrawide + 5 MP f/2.2 for Macro + 5 MP f/2.2 for DOF. The main camera with 64 megapixel and big aperture number will help us take better light at dark situations.. 3) LCD screen resolutions use Super AMOLED for good color display. The screen resolutions also already have Full HD+ at 1080 x 2340 pixels.. 4) have big battery 6000 mAh. This is very important for anyone who want to use Android smartphone more then 2 days at standard activity.. 5) have big battery 6000 mAh. This is very important for anyone who want to use Android smartphone more then 2 days at standard activity.. Cons. 1) Charging time, It will take nearly 3hrs to full charge. 2) Front camera does not have LED flight flash for selfie photo. This camera is located at top of LCD screen. But we can use LCD display brightness for light help.. 3) Not water resistance.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1827,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Savitha,Budget Worthy,"I have wanted to buy this phone ever since I saw it would be launching. But I had to wait 2 months for several reasons before I got it.. A piece of advice if you do buy it.. Please charge the phone completely before using it for the first time. It's really helpful. I've read many reviews here and everyone who found it faulty probably didn't charge it to 100% before first use (It does gets heated the first time. Don't worry about it.) Now to the review. Waiting two months eagerly for this... my expectations were as high as it could be and my phone did meet it to a great extent.. Fingerprint reader is great though sometimes it does not recognize on the first try. But again for the budget it's pretty good.. The display has to be the biggest pros of the phone. I was so obsessed with it I didn't even want to use a screenguard XD. It is very smooth and videos look great on it.. The back of the phone also looks very attractive despite what I've read about it. It does get fingerprints all over it but nothing that can't be rid of.. Face unlock I had to try just for the review and it is pretty good. (Keep in mind I tried it only for a few minutes, just a couple tries). Battery life is really good. I usually binge watch TV shows on my phone and it would last for a day and a half. When I tried gaming, I didn't find any freezing or lagging. But the battery does start reducing a little more quickly ( It would still last for the whole day) and sometimes heats up but nothing to be worried about.. Coming to the camera, the default camera is 16MP and you'll have to change it to 64MP and you can't zoom in using 64MP. Also it takes up more space. But the camera quality is pretty awesome. However the video and every other mode are in 16MP. The front camera default is 16MP too I presume, and ultrawide front camera is 21MP and you can change it to 32MP. The front camera is great too. However I don't recommend the phone to hardcore photo enthusiasts considering it might not meet your expectations. But keeping the budget in mind I give it 5 stars. The video mode is good however the super steady mode is very grainy.(I'm not sure how exactly it works yet). And the super slo-mo video can only be used in daylight for best results. Photos in lowlight are not the best. But there is a flash option for front camera where the screen goes bright white during a shot and it compensates really well. I was happy with most of the camera features but it isn't the best being a photo enthusiast myself. It still does a great job nonetheless. The performance is amazing.. Talking about storage the system takes up 16GB and other 4GB gets used up while setting up. You basically get 108GB give or take as your storage(For 128GB variant). It's been almost 11 days since I got the phone and it's done a great job of impressing me and my family. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a budget friendly smartphone. And to those trying to cut off Chinese products.Overall I have had a pretty awesome and exciting experience with it so a five star rating. Totally would recommend.. Update: 3 months later. Still very good. Camera quality is really awesome now I've played with it enough. But battery life is not completely to the mark of 6000 mAh but it's still pretty great. Would recommend Samsung m31s now. But if you can't afford that this is the best choice for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1829,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Amazon Customer,Great Value For Money!,"A great phone for the price. Here are the pros and cons:. PROS:. 1. 6000mAh battery that easily lasts for more than a day.. 2. 6 GB RAM that makes switching between tasks very smooth and quick.. 3. Quad camera setup takes excellent pictures. (The photo of the box was taken on the M31.) The 32 megapixel front camera also takes great selfies.. 4. The super Amoled display is on par with all the flagship devices. Amazing viewing experience.. 5. Comes with latest Android 10.. 6. Although the processor isn't a flagship chipset, it can easily handle games like Asphalt 9, Call of Duty Mobile, PUBG, etc. at high graphics without any visible lag.. 7. Manufactured in India. During this time when boycott of Chinese goods is on the rise, this is the best alternative to any other Chinese branded phone on the market at the price range.. Cons:. 1. Certain aspects of OneUI 2.0 are missing. Like edge lighting, secure folder, knox security, which are available on models like A51, which runs on the same chipset.. Final review: Although certain aspects available on other samsung models are not on the phone, the pros heavily outweigh the cons, making this one of the best value for money smartphones. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a phone between ₹15,000 to ₹20,000.",5.0 out of 5 stars

To be honest, I was skeptical in going for a samsung phone after a bitter experience in 2010 with one of the earlier galaxy Y phone. However, I find this phone good enough in this price range if one wants to opt for non Chinese phone. I wanted a phone with 4k video recording capability and this phone has a pretty decent camera. To my surprise, i find even the front camera is capable of 4k video. The battery lasts a day for heavy usage and for a normal usage, it would go almost a day and half. In terms of memory, this is a 6GB, 128GB model and therefore the best one can ask for in this price bracket.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have hard reset the phone, put the phone in power saving mode with 70% CPU usage, re-installed the official firmware and none of these have worked.. From what I could gather on the internet, it seems to be an issue with Motherboard or processor. Samsung should repair the phone FOC since its their faulty board and processor.. Overall, I'm happy with the phone. Does what I expect in this price range.. Pros:. 1. Great battery life, I'm getting nearly 14 hours of SOT.. 2. Decent screen. 3. Value for price.. Cons:. 1.

Though I purchased the phone after going through many reviews I still had my doubts but on using it I am completely satisfied with the product. But the efficiency of a phone in different aspects of it differs from each user according to its usage but as someone who does use the phone a lot it is a really great purchase. The overall pros and cons that I felt are :. Pros. Good quality display. Excellent battery backup. Ample RAM and Storage. Above average camera (both front and back). Fast fingerprint sensor and face unlock. And con would be that I wouldn't recommend the phone for high end games as it may start to heat up..

It has got everything which a user need to have under 20k. Much better than other Chinese phones and the built quality if amazing. One can never feel that this phone Carries a 6k MAH battery. Picture quality is amazing and the super Amoled screen is just icing on the cake viz super smooth and crisp and responsive mind it you are just paying 17 or 18k for a samsung product with these specs.. Gaming:. I don't find any issues with this phone as far as gaming is concerned. I play pubg with mo lag at all at smooth ultra resolution. Yes, HDR ultra or HD Extreme is a bit laggy after sometime (30 min ) but you can play with HD extreme with issues and will be so much fun.. It is worth buying for someone who is looking for a feature packed phone with Korean tech and an alternate for chinese viz useless to spend upon as most of the chinese creates problem as soon as your warranty is over.",5.0 out of 5 stars

To my surprise, the phone matched my Expectations. Have to appreciate Amazon for the super fast delivery, I ordered it by night around 10pm and I got the phone delivered by next day morning 9am. Packing was good and safe.. I'm writing this mobile review based on my first 2 days experience with this phone. Will add later if there is anything.. Pros:. 1. Very nice battery. It was coming roughly 2 days for a moderate usage in 4G.. 2. Camera is very decent. Even though it doesn't justify 64mp, still I would say camera is good with clear pictures.. 3. Display is too good. 4. Phone is not very heavy and good to use. 5. Voice clarity and signal is good. 6. Looks very good and stylish too.. Cons:. 1. Finger print is placed very high in the back, needs to stretch a bit to reach the sensor. 2. Charging is very slow(I understand its 6000mah), roughly 2.5hrs, could have given charger with more watts.. 3. Charging cable length is very short. 4. No earphones provided with this mobile.. 5. Speaker is not much loud as only one speaker is provided at the bottom. 6. Has mild heat when we play high end games, but its not too heat also.

(1) Since about 2 weeks, it has been overheating on fairly routine functions. Particularly, when I make video calls, the phone overheats so much after about 15-20 min that it shuts down the application!. (2) Fingerprint reader was pretty good initially but after a few months, it does not work smoothly. Nowadays, I find myself opening the phone through the pass-code about a third of the time.. (3) Too much bloatware and random software being installed whenever there is a system update.. Had no issues at all with my previous Sony and two Honor phones, all of which worked smoothly for years. Goes to show, should never buy the crap that Samsung puts out - have seen many other phones of Samsung also have issues.",3.0 out of 5 stars

1841,Reviewed in India on 14 September 2020,m.gopi,Worth the money,"So first of all i want to clear few thing about this phone which many of them might think that it's a problem. 1.first the macro camera would not be accurate which is common for quad camera phones, first i also thought it's a defect but after seeing the phone in some youtube videos i realized it is not a defect. 2. Second is when i switched on my phone it gone to the boot page and i was shocked but it isn't a problem at all so don't worry. 3.the third thing is, your phone will discharge a bit faster for the first four days and it's normal and you don't need to think about any return or replacement of your phone. So, finally the review. >The phone's camera is very good. >The phone gives screen on time of around 10.5hours. >this phone's display is marvellous, right from viewing angles to brightness and clarity of the phone. >the performance is very good in normal usage and about gaming i don't know because i don't play games. Thank you for reading my review",5.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung Galaxy M31: The Good, The Bad, And The X Factor. By Sandeep Sarkar. Updated: Friday, March 20, 2020, 16:56 [IST]. Samsung has added a new handset in the Galaxy M series dubbed Galaxy M31. The company introduced this series last year to compete against its Chinese counterparts like Xiaomi and Realme who own a major chunk of the market with feature-rich smartphones being offered an affordable price tag.. The latest entrant comes as a successor to the Galaxy M30s which has been quite popular in the mid-range segment. Carrying some traits from its predecessor, the Galaxy M31 is packed with a humongous 6,000 mAh battery and an L-shaped quad-camera module.. At a starting price label of Rs. 14,999 for the 6GB RAM+64GB storage and Rs. 15,999 for the 6GB RAM+128GB storage model, it goes up against the likes of the Honor 9X, Redmi Note 8 Pro, and the Realme XT. Let's see what this device brings to the table and how good is it against the Chinese rivals in our initial impressions:. Samsung Galaxy M31: The Good. High-Resolution Super AMOLED Display. The first thing that will grab your attention while buying this handset is its big high-resolution display. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with a 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display that churns out 1080 x 2340 pixels FHD+ resolution and has a tall 19:5:9 aspect ratio. Samsung has never compromised with the display quality; which seems evident on the Galaxy M31 as well.. The tall display complemented by high-resolution support makes it suitable for 1080p videos. Moreover, the narrow bezels all around the display give you the maximum area to watch content. The U-shaped notch is slightly bigger.. The colors delivered are punchy and vivid, something which you will find on other mid-range Samsung smartphones as well. The viewing angles and sunlight visibility seems good. But, we will be able to give feedback after a thorough usage. It is worth noting that this is the same display that the company had used on its predecessor, i.e, the Galaxy M30s. So, you can expect the same display output.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1844,Reviewed in India on 2 August 2020,atharva,Monstorous m31,"The Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that’s pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there’s a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn’t feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone’s liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.. At the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ’64 megapixels’ mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There’s also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phones.. The 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight. However, since this is the same panel as the one on the Galaxy M30s, the bezels are rather big for a 2020 smartphone. The bottom bezel in particular is an eyesore, though I guess we can’t complain considering the M31’s price tag.. The Galaxy M31 has a headphone jack, for those wondering. But you will have to buy your own headphones, as there are no earphones in the box. There’s no case, either: All you get is a USB-C cable and a 15W Samsung fast charger, which was also the case (no pun intended) with the Galaxy M30s. You will need a case, though, if you want to keep the phone in a pristine condition, as the back panel picks up scratches very easily.. Galaxy M31 camera. The M31 is Samsung’s cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There’s plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.. It’s the nighttime performance where the M31 drops the ball. First off, the phone simply has too much shake even when you hold it in two hands, and with a single hand, well, good luck getting a perfectly clear picture. If you do manage it, you get sufficient detail and little noise when there’s good artificial lighting around. In the dark, things aren’t so rosy. Samsung is marketing the M31 as having an amazing camera Night mode, but that Night mode isn’t exactly that great.. First off, the Night mode photos are cropped considerably so you see a lot less in the frame compared to standard photos. Secondly, Night mode photos have a watercolor painting effect and often have their detail smudged when it should be the other way around. Finally, some scenes don’t show noticeable difference when captured in Night mode. Night mode is great for brightening up a scene when it’s too dark, but otherwise, it doesn’t really work as well as Samsung would make you think.. Here are a couple of photos captured both in auto mode and in Night mode:. The ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s’ ultra-wide camera. It’s useful to capture a wider scene, but don’t expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it’s great if you love taking close-up shots, though it’s often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.. Here are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots.. For selfies, the Galaxy M31 has a 32MP camera and manages to take pleasing pictures outdoors. By default, you get 8MP photos, but you can switch to 32MP mode if you like to see more details in your selfies. At night, detail is lost whether it’s an 8MP photo or a 32MP photo, and you can also expect some camera shake if you don’t hold the phone steady using all the willpower you can muster.. In case you’re wondering, you can capture 4K videos with the front camera as well. Other camera features include Live Focus mode for bokeh shots with the front and rear cameras, which works pretty well most of the time (see some samples below). You can also capture Super Slow-mo and standard slow motion videos and create AR Emojis. Standard modes like Hyperlapse and Panorama are present as well.. The Galaxy M31 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M30s, Galaxy A50s, and Galaxy A51. It’s the processor choice for Samsung’s budget and lower mid-range phones, and all I can say is that it gets the job done in day-to-day use. The M31 runs smoothly as long as you don’t try to switch apps and browse through the user interface too quickly. Apps mostly launch quickly, and since there’s 6GB of RAM on both the 64GB and 128GB storage variants, multitasking isn’t usually an issue.. Gaming performance is pretty good in titles like Call of Duty and PUBG, at least at the default graphics settings. The phone can stutter here and there when you initially load a game and start playing, but those stutters don’t show up after the first minute or two. It also didn’t have issues running well at the ultra frame rate setting in PUBG, and games like Asphalt 9 and Modern Combat 5 also run fine. This is something I also noticed on the Galaxy A50 and M30s – the Exynos 9610/9611 isn’t great for the general user interface, but its Mali-G72 MP3 GPU handles popular gaming titles very well.. Galaxy M31 software. Like every other Galaxy phone Samsung has launched in 2020, the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box. Well, it runs One UI Core 2.0, which is a stripped down version of One UI 2.0 that Samsung also brought to the Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M30 with the Android 10 update. You don’t get features like the built-in screen recorder or even something as basic as Secure Folder. Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini aren’t supported, either. Bixby is completely missing as well, except for Bixby Vision in the camera app.. And when I pressed Samsung about why the M series runs One UI Core even though devices like the M30s and M31 have the same processor as the Galaxy A51, which do get standard One UI 2.0 (though not with all features), I was told the company designs each phone according to the target market. But that doesn’t explain why stuff like Samsung Pay Mini and Secure Folder aren’t part of the package, and I can only assume Samsung wants to keep some features exclusive to costlier phones.. Since the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 out of the box, it will receive an update to Android 11 and Android 12 at some point. Android 11 might arrive quickly – the Galaxy M20 and M30 received the Android 10 update before the Galaxy Note 10 did, after all. Security updates are likely to come once every three months for the first two years, and whenever necessary from the third year onward.. Galaxy M31 battery life. With a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it’s no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won’t have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.. The M31 supports 15W fast charging. With such a big battery, faster charging speeds don’t matter that much, and given the price point Samsung is targeting with the M series, we probably won’t see the fast charging specification change any time soon. Still, it would be nice to have, as a full charge from 0 takes around two hours and a half. An hour of charging takes the charge to around 30 percent, though that 30 percent does last a considerable while.. Galaxy M31 audio and call quality. The M31 has a single bottom-firing loudspeaker that gets the job done if you’re in a small room but is too quiet to hear even at full volume otherwise. It’s the same story with every budget Galaxy phone, and the M31 doesn’t do anything to change that. Like the M30s’ speaker, the M31’s doesn’t distort at the highest volume, though, which is a plus. It could just do with a bit more depth in the low frequencies (bass).. For wired audio, you will need to opt for a third-party product as no earphones are bundled with the phone. When used with earphones from other budget/mid-range Galaxy smartphones, the M31 produces sound that is very heavy on the high frequencies (treble) but lacks punch in the lower frequencies. As for call quality, I noticed no issues with either of the two SIMs I was using, except for the fact that both the earpiece and the loudspeaker are on the quieter side and make it hard to hear what the person on the other end is saying.. Galaxy M31 verdict. The Galaxy M31 is more or less a Galaxy M30s with a macro camera, a higher-resolution main camera, more RAM on the base variant, and newer software out of the box. And the Galaxy M30s’ base variant, priced at Rs 12,999, is the better pick if you’re on an extremely tight budget. If you have Rs 14,999 lying around, then the Galaxy M31 offers excellent value for money. It would have been nice to see more feature-packed software, better quality from the 64MP rear camera in low light, and perhaps an Infinity-O display with smaller bezels, but for the asking price, these are all nitpicks that shouldn’t affect your decision to get the phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I ordered it as a rakhi gift for my brother and when we unboxed it the product screen was cracked and the camera wasnt working properly the screen was glitching, I have been calling customer service continuously since 3rd august and neither Amazon nor samsung are ready to help and provide me a replacement as a result of each passing day the glass is being cracked more. The samsung service centre people are so incompetent and rude and the Samsung and Amazon are both just putting the blame on each other and not helping me in any given way. They're asking me to pay additional 3k to change my screen and only then they will give services for camera and glitches.

The camera works just fine and tbh sometimes it even gives you the shot just like dslr... Battery, damn once your phone learns the way you use your batter it will give you 23hr screen on time which is op.. I am a pubg player with graphics hdr+high+shadows enabled+colorful and it only comsumes 10 percent in 1 hour which is 😍. It is a mega monster battery.. It would have been more better if they woukd provide a mobile cover, headphones and a more fast charging adapter.. But there is one disadvantage and that is the chipset.. It sucks..

Finger print scanner is decent. I didn't liked the face unlock, it is slow and sometimes don't even detect my face. I didn't liked one thing that we have to reset our phone to factory version if we want to change the PIN given at the time of setup. Camera is really good when lighting is properly and in low light is OK. I liked the variant of 6GB RAM 64GB ROM cause it has 512GB of expandable storage so can buy a memory card if required or can just go for 6GB RAM 128GB ROM storage cause it requires only ₹1,000 more. Processor is decent but Samsung should have improved it. Colour variety is not here only two colours BLACK and BLUE which also gets easy fingerprints on it so I recommend to get one phone case. I didn't liked that they didn't gave a earphone in the box. Battery is massive 6000mAh with 15 Watt charge is really good.

1869,Reviewed in India on 2 September 2020,Kamal Kumar,Good phone at this price change for regular use (not for heavy gaming),Pros:. - UI is good. - Display is Good. - Battery life is average. - No lag in playing games like PUBG at high. resolution. - Sound is loud and clear. - Response of finger print scanner is good. - Inbuilt malware and virus scan + device optimisation + device troubleshooting.. Cons. - Quality of back cover is average. - Battery at 100% will suffice for a day's. use. However it is not serving justice to. boasted monster battery capacity.. - Camera quality is very good when the. lighting is good otherwise average. - Takes at least 1.5 hrs to 2 hrs to charge 100% using fast charge and minimum 4 hrs using normal charging option.,5.0 out of 5 stars
1870,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Abhinandan Jain,Watta Monster!,"My Samsung Galaxy M31 arrived in ocean blue color.. The battery lasts a whole day if you hit it hard with games. It can be said that I was there all day, from when I woke up to when I fell asleep playing on the mobile and using it and it lasted with a 10% battery surplus. No doubt, great battery life!. The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything.. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone. Decent camera quality!. Processor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaints with anything about this mobile and 128GB of internal storage, I did not even consider using the microSD slot since 128GB is more than enough for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1872,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020,Deepa,Awesome!!,"I ordered this phone within few hours of launch, and was promptly delivered the very next day. Thanks to Amazon for on time delivery. I bought the ocean blue, 128 GB variant which is kind of dark blue and I really love the colour. I am no techie to review the phone on its technical aspects but as a common layman I truly love its performance since the 3 days I have been using it.. The set up took really less time than I expected and it comes with Smart Switch App, which made the data transfer easy and smooth.. The pictures clicked from the phone are extremely good and nice, however I saw a flicker of light when I tried to take a slowmotion video. I am not sure if the flickering was because of the light or the issue was with the camera. but there was not such flickering while capturing a slowmotion video in daylight.. The battery back up seems to be amazing, Since 3 days I have charged it only once. (Other than the charging done on the first day for 3 hours). But the charging is not as fast, and I feel the 15V charger is not good enough for the 6000 MaH Battery. Overall I loved the phone it is smooth, fast and Vibrant.... and Im loving it",5.0 out of 5 stars

I am not a heavy user so these things might get different from others, but for me, I am satisfied with its performance as per my needs.. The only thing which I do not like is the fiber back body as now the day's glass body is standard in such a price range.. Oh yes, one more thing. I have paid 1000/- more for the same product.

The camera quality is superb as you can see in these pictures.If you are the one who takes many pics then go for 128gb variant. It surely has a MONSTER battery with it.its been 1 and half days since my first charge it still have 50%left .. Now the gaming performance its decent and I don't feel any kinda lagging while playing pubg at high graphics it's just smooth.I didnt find any heating issue though I can notice some small amount of heat generated while charging. The charging speed is more like 1% per minute (on avg). its soooooooo good Trust me you wont regret after buying it.. The super amoled screen enriches the display,the pictures what you see in your screen looks much better in this phone. Now the drawbacks it's somewhat bulky and the packaging is bad they didnt even bubble wrap it and that's all the drawbacks. Pics in order: front,back,normal cam×2,wide angle,2x macro.

1880,Reviewed in India on 12 August 2020,Apurv Singh,This is not a product review. This review is based on Samsung's after sales treatment.,"The phone itself is an average mid range phone (good battery, fast charging, semi-premium look that is common in this range, average processor and a VERY AVERAGE / POOR camera) that people will prefer (over Chinese manufacturers like Oppo, Xiaomi etc.) because of the brand, namely, Samsung. And I will tell you this, once you buy the product, you are on your own. I was using the phone for a few months when without any physical damage (it has not fallen once, there are no scratches, I handled the phone with care), a purple spot appeared on the screen. Eventually, that spot spread and covered the entire screen so that nothing is visible, leaving the phone unusable. I contacted Samsung and without looking at the phone, they said this is physical damage and it is not covered in the 6 months warranty period. I got the phone at around 16k and they are asking for about 5k to repair it. So this has been my Samsung experience. I will try to take this matter to the Consumer Forum.",1.0 out of 5 stars

1882,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2020,Anna,Best budget phone,This phone for its price is best in class. While Chinese phones may pack more features but Samsung is clearly a class apart.. It has the best fingerprint reader which is blazing fast.. The camera is excellent at the price point and the AR feature is a new addition that is quite fun.. The battery life is awesome. With a 6000 mAh battery it will always last a full day and then some more.. It charges quickly even though it has a large battery thanks to the included fast charger.. The screen is the best at the given price point with crisp and vivid images.. The phone is snappy with zero lag. It runs smoothly.. The fact that it can support dual Sims and an SD Card without any glitches and the fact that you don't have to decide between having two sim cards or one sim and an SD card is excellent.. The gesture controls are handy and call quality is excellent.. All in all this is completely worth the money. At this price point you simply can't get a better phone,5.0 out of 5 stars

Yet another terms, 3 days, when you watch movies, play songs, for about 7 hours daily.. Camera. No words, it is simply amazing. I have not seen such camera in any phone till now. Apart from camera there are many many features too, such as ARDoodle, which is awesome!. The few things which i can say are lacking are:. 1. fingerprint, it sometimes (1 out of 15) doesnot work.. 2.

It offers you a best in class super smiles display and the 64mp quad camera setup is also a true beast. The exynos 9611 is a good processor for day to day usage and is able able to support games such as pubg and fortnite but is not a fully gaming processor at all. This can be the best phone for you if you want a phone for consuming online content on Netflix and amazon prime.If you want the best camera hen also go for it. Added to this is Samsung brand value and the service is also very good. The only concern with this phone is that it’s back panel is polycarbonate and there is no design effect on it. The face unlock is also a bit slow but it might be cured through further software updates. At last I would like to say surely go for it👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻,5.0 out of 5 stars

I am not a pubg gammer but I played sniper 3d game, candy crush in this device but I never face any heating issue.

1910,Reviewed in India on 18 July 2020,JGR,Just average but hyped,"This is selling mostly because in India we don't have much non Chinese phone options. As a product m31 is just average and not reflective of the high ratings people give here.. For price to value - poco x2 or realme 6pro are better options, but don't buy Chinese phones.. The good : battery life, amoled screen. The bad : poor performance - the phone stutters after using a while, WiFi drops, erratic touch responses, half the time fingerprint sensor won't work.. The ugly: form factor and design, competition is much ahead in looks, Too much hype with 64mp and 4 camera setup, does not seem durable too.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1911,Reviewed in India on 1 June 2020,Javed Kauthekar,Not meeting the claims & expectations,"Technical errors experience:. 1. Software Updates from Samsung are shit as they spoil your phone. Issues phased:. -Sim Network and Data connectivity Connectivity drops automatically though network shows sufficient range (has rechecked & found absolutely no issues with Sim or Network) so its purely handset issue. -Start consuming data too fast compared to previous version of software. -Custome Care is unable to facilitate return to previous software version (online download not provided). 2. Contact details though saved correctly shows/display the 'work position' instead of 'name'. Refer attached screenshots.. 3. Though preference is set for SIM1, you get both options before dialing in (making you to force remember which sim to be used). 4. Zoom in & out mode camera picture quality is strange. Refer attached photo.. Selfie camera is better than the rear cameras when it comes to photo results.. 5. Battery charge time is very high as it takes 4 hrs to charge and battery drain is also quite fast (lasted for a day only though use is intermittent for internet scrolling, no games nor much video viewing).. 6. Samsung India not answering queries on technical issues.. Other apps not used much so will come back to update the feedback again.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1912,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,SHYAM JI MISHRA,An excellent product in this range,"I bought this product as soon as the sale started and have been using it since then. The quality of the audio on this phone is great. I found this phone a really great product for someone who wants a good phone in nominal rate. Since then I have recommended this phone to many of my friends and relatives. All the features shown in the ads and written above are correct. The two variants available in ocean blue and space black offer a stylish choice for both girls and boys. Like all other Samsung devices, this phone also comes with a great display. The fingerprint reader works efficiently and the face lock feature is also very fast. I have bought the 128 gb variant so it comes with a lot of memory to store your photos and videos. The best thing about the product that I felt was its camera. If you want a good camera phone at an affordable rate, it is the best. It is literally a mega monster. The battery life is excellent. You can use your phone for 24 hours a day and play games and watch movies without any worries. The charger given along with it charges the phone in a very short time.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The picture quality in low light is awesome and the phone is comparatively light given the battery capacity. It took around 2.5 hours for a full charge and lasted for roughly 1.5 day on my normal usage. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the lack of IR blaster and One UI. One UI doesn't have out of the box support for things like internet speed meter and number of fingerprints that can be registered is limited to 3.

All apps works fine. I'm not a heavy gamer, and this is not a ideal gamer phone too.. Camera is nice. Though the wide angle shots are not upto the mark. Front cam is good in day light. Low light or the night shots aren't that good. The cameras could have been better.. I loved the display of this phone.

There will be a slight lag in unlock when fingerprint sensor is used and some times if you touch it also it says to cover the sensor fully. Earlier I was a mi user but I never found such problem in my old mobile.. Camera and battery are the best things in this mobile.. But some times I see that the phone hangs. This might be a major drawback of this mobile.. Conclusion: If u are a gamer or a heavy user of multimedia. This mobile is not worth for your use. This is good for only those people who use it for nominal multimedia purposes.,4.0 out of 5 stars

1952,Reviewed in India on 30 November 2020,Amin,Best fastest and longest battery in this price range,"I have been using this phone close.to 3 weeks now. In the price range offered, this is one of the best. Large screen with a superb display. The fingerprint reader is very fast in unlocking but I am not sure if the problem is with my positioning but sometimes it does show unidentified. The camera is really great. The front camera takes real good pics especially in a good lighting. The rear camera is superb. The best thing is the battery which lasts a long long time for normal usage that I have like Google meet and social media and movie and music. The ram is 6gb and the phone works so fast.

The keypad of the phone is sometimes erratic might be due to network speed or some other reason. Of course, charging is very fast but the phone gets heated, moreover, it also heated when you run camera and youtube for a long time. However, this problem is widely discussed on the Samsung community page it may due to the Exonys processor, that means a bit hanging probleam.. But the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good choice under INR 20,000. It offers some wide specifications such as a quality camera on both ends and a 6000mAh battery with fast charging support.

In general this was an wonderful product and customer satisfying one!!!!. Cons. *Mobile weight was little bit heavier if you are preferring to a back case. *Cameras were designed to be bulged from the back surface that could lead to sketches if there is any rough handling.

1994,Reviewed in India on 14 March 2020,Sankara,"Don't think twice if you stumble upon M31, because it's best.","Nice product within 16K, although when compared with other options available in market this might not be immediate choice but believe me you will not regret being an Owner of Samsung M31.. Amazing quality of camera have already made me cameramen within my circle and a selfie geek, Battery is as promised, works whole day with just 50% with extensive use of GPS and WIFI and well as internet. What more can be asked for 16k when you are getting 128 GB and 6 GB memory with perfectly great fingerprint sensors and face lock.. Only cons I found: Weight should have been a bit less and size is not very much comfortable with skinny pants.. Overall, best handset in recent times and would always be looking for new models of Samsung within this price range. Good luck Samsung.. After using from last 8 months small hanging problem I am facing, and night vision of camera is not upto the mark high saturation, not getting clear photos in night.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1995,Reviewed in India on 14 December 2020,Amazon Customer,Definitely should buy this. Will not regret buying this ✌,The phone is amazing. Fingerprint sensor is also working upto the mark Maybe its new so maybe thats why its working so perfectly but all over if I have to rate the phone it is 5/4. Cause some times while opening the screen it takes little time to respond that to occurs very rarely. If you people are seeing a phone to buy in range of 15-16k then this is the phone u all must buy. Samsung has provided a great phone keeping budget in mind. Over all the phone is gr8. ✌♥️. I have attached some pics of the phone and some of them are taken from this phone itself. Can check the quality of camera 📷 Forgot to say about battery...battery life is awesome even if my battery is 70-80 it stays upto 1&1/2 day without charging it.

1996,Reviewed in India on 29 May 2020,Sai Anurag ,"Unbiased  review  : it's ideal ""phone"" but not the best one","So I've been using this phone for a few days now n I will try my best to give an unbiased review of the device .... Let's start with design : its pretty average looking , comparable to low end phones , but it dosen't matters as it's done to reduce cost , but even my mom's Redmi 8a looks n feels better , (it's just 7k) , the rear mounted fingerprint sensor is fast but requires your finger to be dry , wet fingers won't open it , its accurate too n can store 3 prints at max. Display : big kudos to Samsung, you know a display is good when it has samsung branding , its super amoled display is vibrant , packs punchy colours n night mode is sook good so much better than poco x2 , easily best display in this range , even compatible to flagship displays of 60 hz. Battery : here it's kinda disappointing , the the sAmoled screen sucks up battery faster than you think n it works like a 5300 mah phone , but in medium battery saving mode it works like a 6000 mah phone , so I'd recommend using that all day , still a good battery nonetheless never managed to get it lower than 30% . Charging time maybe long I.e 2hrs n 30_40 min but it's fair imo , I'd really charging it every day from 7PM to 10 PM then using it all throughout , till this hour again , tip : phones with fast charging shouldn't be charged overnight , n yep it lasts all day. Performance : decent , exynos 9611 is decent in performance , paired with the one ui , its lag free and won't disappoint you , but its smooth , not fast , can't run pubg on 60 fps despite having those settings max to max can go to 45 and sustain on 30+ fps , so run games on medium settings and it's fine, medium n light games run qite well , it's in the range of snapdragon 675 to sd 712 go with poco x2 if pubg is your 1st priority. Speaking of the ui : one ui will not disappoint you , dark mode is the best in this range , has a tones of customization options and its overall a good ui with zero ads , take that miui , blotwates are a lot but you can uninstall them all , just mute the my galaxy app , it sents some annoying notifications sometimes , easily the best ui next to Asus zen ui. Heating issue: yes the battery heats up while charging but it's nothing to worry about , it happens sometimes but it won't heat up that much playing light games , n has mild heating playing pubg on HDR+ultra , also heats up while using camera initially but not now, after using it a few times .. Speaking of camera : camera is overall above average , I liked the photos very well will give 2 samples too , it's good macro camera is decent , 64 mp shots are large and not really that different from its regular shots, but low light performance is bad and without flash its worst. Overall it's good , go with vivo if you need cameras. Overall verdict : if you need to upgrade from some OLd Samsung phone or just a upgrade n pubg / cod or gaming is not your first priority then go for it !. You're also getting a tier 1 brand so servicing is easy. You will love it if you like consuming content like videos. For gaming, go for poco x2v. Small cons ( first world problems 😆🤭) :. No Knox security , its given in all a series phones. Slightly less features than ui of a series phones. Slow face unlock. Can't use flash n EIS together. Macro camera has no autofocus shittier than poco x2's macro camera. No feature to display daily internet uses n internet speed which is present in miui 🤮😂. And finally: Samsung's classical mistake : nothing in the box .... but a charger that too 15 watt , the phone should support at least 18 w but it only supports 15₩ 🙄.

Quad Cameras at the back (64 MP main camera), 32 MP front camera. 3.5 mm jack for headphones. FM radio. Cons. Quick panel doesn't have screen recording & screenshot button.

Currently writing this review I haven't charged the phone for 2 days and still have around 40% charge despite using it frequently.. The music quality while using headphones is amazing, especially due to Dolby Atmos.. Cons:. Sound quality from the phone speaker could be better..

2007,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Shrinivas Pendem,Worth for money.,"The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g. The weight of the smartphone is mainly because of the big 6,000mAh battery that it packs. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with an Exynos 9611 SoC and gets 6GB of RAM. It has two storage variants to choose from, 64GB and 128GB.The 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight. I think so this is the best phone realeased by the samsung upto the date under 20000rupees which serves with monster camera means quad camera of 64mp and 38mp front and back respectively.last bur not the least it has monster battery and the fast fingerprint reader and facereader.you can even create your emojis in it.

Pros. 1) Good Camera. Crisp picture quality. Wide angle facility with background blurring facility.. 2) Enormous Battery backup. It lasts me 2-3 days.. 3) Quite a good amount of memory (128k). Those who do not load huge games, this memory is huge.. 4) Quite a big screen. Aspect ratio is such that it is comfortable to hold.. 5) Super Amoled display given crisp picture on the screen.. 6) Though it has a 6000 mAh battery, the phone is not very heavy.. Cons. 1) Though the fingerprint reader is far better than than earlier Samsung phones, it still needs to improve. The location of the fingerprint reader at the back of the phone is a little cumbersome to operate. On-screen fingerprint reader would have been preferred.. If you are looking for a decent good phone within this budget, go ahead and buy it. It is absolutely the best buy at this price.. 👍👍👍",4.0 out of 5 stars

2012,Reviewed in India on 17 August 2020,Sonakshi Kaushal,BEST BUDGET SMARTPHONE for a medium level user.,I guess this phone can be considered as one of the best from Samsung so far in the mid range market. They have really put in some effort into and it shows. The phone runs smooth as heck so yeah the processor isn't that much of a problem. Since I'm not a heavy gamer so I can't really comment on the gaming aspect. But the camera is as good as a phone from this price range and with a Samsung tag can be which is interestingly very good. Battery life is extremely good. Love it. The fingerprint scanner works perfectly fine too. And then the basic Samsung features that you get are always good..

Samsung's OneUI is smooth without any lags. 6gb if RAM makes it a good run with a superb 64 mp rear camera. Front one is decent. I am using after using a Xiaomi note 6 pro. But Redmi's looks are updated where Samsung is far behind. Metal /glass body to these phones will make them superior in appearance to other chinese models. Maybe m31s will serve that purpose I guess. If you put a nice back cover to this, problem could be resolved by the way... Overall a nice buy over other models in this price tag.... Pros. Amoled FHD display. Rear camera.

2015,Reviewed in India on 27 March 2020,abhineet,Amazing phone with #MEGAMONSTER battery,"Theis phone completely suits to all my needs. I have been using realme 3 pro for the last 1 year. The phone was quite good, but the samsung m31 beats it in almost every category. This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.. The phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.. It has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.. The only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.. In the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades. But for now I'm 99 percent satisfied with this phone( aside from that palm swipe screenshot). This is a must buy phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2016,Reviewed in India on 27 March 2020,Kaustuv Raj Dutta,Samsung M31 after 1 month of usage.,"I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.. Pros:. Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.. My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.. Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.. Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.. Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.. Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.. Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Here is review after a week's usage -. 1) The build quality of phone certainly ferls premium for this budget.. 2) Display is where I believe this device will surely outclass it's rivals. 6.4inch SAMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution looks gorgeous and colours pop out brilliantly. Even in direct sunlight I have no issues in seeing the content.. 3) Camera quality is top notch even in low lighting conditions whether it be 64MP Rear cams or 32MP. Front, I infact felt the front camera better than my Galaxy Note 10+ in certain lighting conditions. Plus you get quad camera setup with ultra wide, macro and 4th cam for depth sensing, slow motion, 4k video shoot at 30fps.. 4) Battery life is Terrific, 6000MAH lasts easily 2 days on a moderate usage with 4g Calls, WhatsApp, fee gaming, browsing and youtube content. Icing on the cake is it comes with a 15w fast charger which is superb.. 5) Biometrics works just fine wether it's fingerprint or face unlock, accurate and fast.. 6) Best part is it comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is quite a feature these days. Although Samsung could have provided a headphone with it which I feel is a mandate, but nevertheless the prescene of 3.5mm jack won't feel you sad about it.. 7) Internal 6gb of ram and 64gb of storage for base model is quite decent and performance is is quite good. It's fast, there is no lag in any apps. Morever you can expand it via external micosd card upto 1TB.. 8) It has an inbuilt FM Radio which was quite surprising feature. There is one bottom firing speaker which ain't stereo but it's quite loud. Can't expect everything at this pricepoint. Moreover you get Dolby Atmos feature as well so mulimedia experience is quite good.. 9) It comes with android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 which I think Samsung has done quite a good job balancing the design, features & usability where I think it's close to being the best software experience on an android. It's easy and clean to use.. 10) Overall a well made device with a good usable feature set and good performance, great cameras, terrific battery and software experience. Would highly recommend it as one of the purchasing options while buying a phone in this pice range.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I love the display bcoz of its colours, vividness, and above all black levels are just superb 👌😍. 2. Camera - 8.5/10. Main camera is good, wide angle lens also however there is no use of macro lens for me but quality is good however it only captures images upto 5cm while others can take upto 2cm.. I noticed one difference between main camera and ultra wide lens in sky photography that in normal mode image has colours as that of sky accordingly like orange, blue, reddish but in ultra wide lens the colours are overall.. 3. Battery 9/10. For me it runs well (1.5 day) and charges within 2-3 hrs according to that level when I put it on charge.. 4. Performance 8.5/10. I'm a casual user and for me it hasn't disappointed me yet. I play games like asphalt and it runs well however I haven't try pubg. 5. RAM management 9/10. Verdict: I loved this phone.

2031,Reviewed in India on 23 March 2020,Manish,Power packed Smartphone in pocket friendly price,"Samsung Galaxy M31 is a power packed Complete Smartphone. I did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and I did not find myself waiting for an app to load all over again.. The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. I enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which let you stream full-HD content.. I played PUBG Mobile on the Galaxy M31, and the game defaulted to high settings by default with the graphics set to HD and the frame rate to High. The game was playable at these settings and I did not notice any issues. After playing for 20 minutes noticed a four percent battery drop, and the device did get warm to the touch. The big battery will allow you to play for quite long without needing to plug the smartphone into the charger.. With my usage, the battery lasted us for close to two days without any issues. If battery life is important to you, the Galaxy M31 will not disappoint.. Samsung Galaxy M31 cameras. I found the Galaxy M31 to be quick to detect what it's pointed towards and lock focus in daylight. Photos turned out well and had decent details. Text at a distance was legible on zooming in. The smartphone enables HDR automatically if required. Switching to the wide-angle-camera is easy and you can get a wider field of view. However, while these shots look great as is, zooming in reveals that this sensor misses out on details. Wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges.. The Galaxy M31 is capable of separating subjects and backgrounds when shooting close-ups, giving a natural depth effect. The macro camera takes decent shots.. In low-light the Galaxy M31 takes longer to lock focus, so you will need to be patient while taking shots",5.0 out of 5 stars

As usual a best display from samsung the colours are vivid and punchy.. 2) battery - really this is the monster in battery segment it comes with the huge 6000 mAh battery which easily stands for 1 day in heavy usage for light usage it may stand more than 2 days.. 3)UI - as that the Ui is personal opinion . the one UI have retained the stock os without bulk bootlogger .. 4)camera- when i buy i used to see reviews my reviews were that performance of camera is not upto the mark.But the device comes with 16mp mode as default that the 64mp use huge storage, so whenever it is necessary u may switch to 64 mp mode. the pic was crisp and natural.. 5) RAM management- i bought 8gb variant and i didn 't face any reloading or reopening of apps while switching.. cons:-. 1) built - the built quality is not that premium as they used plastic insted of glass.but there is no creeking or worse . they used plastic to maintain the weight of device below 200gm.. 2)Protection- the device comes with corning gorilla glass 3 in front. at this price segment many others offer 6.. 3)processor - it comes with exynos 9611 processor . this is not that worse processor, this is best for day to day use and for games with light and medium settings (here the answer for many others question yes you can run pubg with meduim setting without any lag or framedrops and free fire can be run in ultra graphics without any lags) overall with processor it is best for light gamers not for intense gamers and also here the display again make the gameplay next level.. 4)accessories - first it comes with 15w fast charge support it takes 1 and 1\2 hr to get full in fast charge on and takes 3 hr in fast charge off mode. but i personally recommend to charge without fast charge .that makes a notable difference in battery standby. and one more thing it is difficult to drain this battery to 0.. as back is plastic it easily picks the fingerprint and smugdes easily and that samsung haven't gave their tpu case here and it is very important to use the case.. This is the detailed review that i have made for u to make your choice . and i hope it will be usefull to the internet shopping surffers.. at last in disclaimer i request to record the video of unboxing that will be useful while any defect or missing or change of product. so be careful . happy purchase... i 'm happy with what i bought..",4.0 out of 5 stars

Pros:- 1 - The processsor is super fast and we can easily multitask without any lag.. 2- The reason why i choose this phone over Redmi was the AMOLED display offered by samsung which is awesome. Now i can watch movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime with better picture Quality as it feels like i am watching in a theatre.. 3- Sound Quality is super as it provides with DOLBY ATMOS in this range .. 4- The amazing part is that it has a battery of 6000mah which is impossible to get from any great brand like Samsung. I charge it after 3 days if using on a normal basis.. 5- The camera of this phone makes your picture is being clicked by a DSLR. I have now started using this for clicking my pictures and stopped using my DSLR. This phone is a go ahead and experience the great features with it..

2050,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Kindle Customer,True to how the phone was heralded. This phones is a monster when it comes to Battery and Camera,"I have been using this phone for over 2 months now. The major reason why I went for this model was its battery. After putting the phone to mild-high usage everyday (amdist the lockdown), the battery safely lasted just over a day (~26-28 hours). I use many services concurrently - Bluetooth, Data, GPS, Hotspot. So the battery drain in my device would be faster. In any normal use pattern, this battery can easily last a day and half. As far as charging is concerned, there are a lot of discussions online regarding the charging time for this model, as the charger comes with a 15W power capacity. From my experience, I would say, it charges fast untill it reaches a certain threshold afterwhich the charging becomes slow. So, you can expect your phone to buff up to around 40% battery in next to no time, but if you would like to completely charge the device, then leaving it plugged in as you sleep might be your best option. Another great thing about Samsung M31 is its Camera. The front camera has 32MP and takes very beautiful selfies. In the Live Focus mode, you can blur off the background and obtain a high aperture-esque effect in your photos. The Macro mode is also very powerful and would be suited for subjects with high detail per unit area - an insect, a flower, a fruit etc. As a consequence, you will have to go up close to the subject to really appreciate the power of the Macro mode. This is made slightly difficult as the camera doesnt auto focus in the macro mode. But with Macro mode, you almost never get auto focus anyways. The main 64 MP camera is also quite sharp. Sometimes, you may be tempted to use the 64MP over the Macro Mode because of the quality the 64 MP camera packs in. I have not been able to step out and click landscape pictures using the 64 MP back camera, but if household images are to stand any testimony, this 64 MP beast must rival a mid range DSLR easily. If you download Lightroom from the App store (which is a free app by Adobe), you can get going with your new hobby and have some good impressionable snaps to show off. If you get used to these three camera modes, the other modes becomes largely redundant. Food mode and Night mode are probably helpful (Especially in low light). Only point where Samsung could have done better is the finishing of the product. The images put up on the website flatters the actual product. The back cover is a poly carbonate finger print magnet. It would be worth your money to invest in a back cover (As the package doesnt come with one included in it). Samsung has a lot of preloaded apps but you can uninstall most and for the ones which you cannot uninstall, you always have the option to mute notifications. The processor is a new chip and would obviously pale in comparison against the Qualcomms and Realteks, but with 15k you can only expect so much. I do not play large graphic intensive games on my device, so would not be able to tell the performance in those situations. But the phone holds itself in modest esteem when I tried Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, Plants Vs Zombies etc. Smooth and no problems. Media playback has also been satisfactory and the large screen really does help the resolution. Bear in mind, that for some videos on Youtube/Netflix/Prime, you wont be able to go the entire length of the screen. If you drag and stretch the video, you might fill the screen, but loose out on some details along the edges.. All in all, this megamonster does good on all it promises and would really qualify as a great Value for Money option. If Battery and Camera is your thing, go for this product with your eyes closed!",5.0 out of 5 stars

The charger that came along with my set was white in colour.. Though, there is a bug in the phone (which is also found in Galaxy S10+) where the in-call speaker becomes your primary speaker. You can google about this bug. Hopefully, samsung will resolve it in the future updates.. Android 10 and one core is great. There are application like Bixby vision, AR emojis which is novel and interesting. Game launcher is also great in managing and organizing games.. Back cover is must as the back panel is shiny and smudges doesn't look great. Overall, the phone is great and price is reasonable.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The fingerprint sensor mismatch rate is slightly high. Phone automatically restarts ( happened twice). After every update the bloatware apps ask to install some app I find this annoying. Overall this phone is good buy for the provided specs. I would recommend this phone.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Pros:. 1. Not at all delicate, samsung has made sure that their product is made with excellent durable materials.. 2. Even after using several apps at same time it never showed any lag.. 3. Good battery backup with fast charging.. 4. Moderate heating only while charging.. Cons:. 1. Camera doesn't come up to the expected hype that was created by youtubers.. 2. Finger print sensor doesn't work often when fingers are little bit wet/sweaty.. 3. Size of the phone is little big, not so easy to use in single hand.. .. Overall I would reccomend this handset to everyone who is looking for a phone that performs your daily rough use tasks with average use of camera, games, binge watching.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2063,Reviewed in India on 9 June 2020,Pramanshu,"Stunning, Impressive, Well done Samsung","Let me expand on first impression; the packaging was good, sturdy and sanitized — which is great. Smarphone came with all the accessories written on the box.. There was no charge in the unit—odd I remembered samsung delivering fifty percent charge in there products, either way I did boot it up after leaving it for charge for around three hours — fast, responsive display, beautiful camera. And you can set settings of the display to natural colour.. Software: As far as the Samsung's own UI is concern, I think it's intuitive, lacks some crazy fastness of AOSP or android one projects — but with the phone one is paying for the software as well. And might as well, use these OEMs rather than running something plain. It's stable so far and running great. Fingerprint is pretty fast, as fast as my other device poco F1. Battery line is absolutely wonderful, it takes almost 3 hours I think to be fully charged, with standard usage it gives me screentime of around 36 hours sometimes 24, while playing PUBG or Call of duty.. Camera quality: Well, I only have one word, impressive. Camera on this phone is social butterfly's or some serious smartphone photography, videography — although no video stabilisation in 4k mode.. Some things to look out for: Phone body catches smudges easily, so get a cover if you are serious about it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Next battery life, it truly has a monstrous battery but apps like zoom and google meet consume a lot of battery,anyway the battery lasts easily for more than day even with heavy usage. Next is camera,it is kinda mixed feeling, front camera is no doubt great,however comparing to other phones in same price range,the rear camera could be slightly better. In short both front and back camera are nice. The design of the phone however could be better.

The battery life is good as I now charge my phone once in 1.5 days, instead of twice the same day with my previous smartphone.. However, the phone may take a while to charge (precisely 2.5 hrs) despite of its fast charging feature.

There is a little bit of noise in low light, but it doesn't ruin the pictures, like in some other phones. The colours are natural, not enhanced and artificial like they seem in Mi phones.

Samsung give this variant at very low price like 6,64 in 15999 and 6,128 in 16999. No one gives that 6,128 in RS1Ik more which is pretty cool. While other gives top variant in more rate. Display is super good. One main option its sound quality is good like in xaomi phone that I used it's on call hearing quality is super worst. In this phone the fingerprint and face unlock is little slow but it is ok. Its is light weight phone and its screen size makes it fully grip in hand.

2074,Reviewed in India on 13 March 2020,Pugazhenthi,Best and Good mobile,"Galaxy M31 sports a rectangular camera module at the back in the top left corner. The camera setup comprises three camera sensors and an LED flash. There is a fingerprint scanner in the middle, followed by the Samsung branding at the bottom. Upfront, there is a waterdrop notch at the top and fewer bezels. The chin has a 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and speaker grille (from left to right). The head doesn’t have anything. The left side of the smartphone is home to a SIM slot and the left side houses the volume rocker and the power on/off button. Speaking of the volume button, it is placed quite high and reaching it wasn’t as easy as it is on any other smartphone.. The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch.. The M31 is Samsung’s cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There’s plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.. With a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it’s no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won’t have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.",5.0 out of 5 stars

What I always loved is samsung display and one touch ui as it is very user friendly thats what make me samsung fan..

2090,Reviewed in India on 15 June 2020,Shouvik,One of the best Non Chinese phones to buy at this price,"First impressions - The super amoled screen quality is a bit oversaturated and the white looks a tad bit yellowish but can be worked with. The cameras are decent performers, not exceptional with the 64 mp and other lenses but not that bad also. Pictures are sharp and have less noise and good details in day light and somewhat decent even in artificial lighting. Performance is good and smooth for day to day work and the battery helps with that. Though it doesn't perform like a 6000 mah battery but still will get you over a full day. The charging takes around 2 and a half hours to go from 0 to 100. All in all its a pretty decent phone to use in 2020 and if you are just a normal user and want to use your phone for long periods of time without charging, then this is the one for you. I hope samsung provides regular updates so that this phone can be used for the next 2 to 3 years.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2091,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2020,Avi K.,"Best mobile phone under 20,000","This is the best mobile phone under Rs 20,000. My detailed review after a week of usage.. 1. Battery life - This phone has full day battery life. I don't have a television and mobile phone is my only source of entertainment. So you can imagine my usage pattern. I used to charge my old phone two times a day but not this beast. Easily runs through the day with maximum usage including moderate.l GPS navigation and high brightness.. 2. Display - Again no other brand can dare to compare. Not even iphone. Best display. Keeping this one short because i am short of words for this display.. 3. User Interface - Everything on point. One UI 2.0 is a treat to operate. Using samsung phone after a long time and it feels great to be back home after using MIUI ( xiaomi ) , EMUI ( Huawei ) and one plus. UI has all the important features and perfect placement to make it highly efficient and usefull. Screen transitions are joyful. Smoothness of another level. Feels like butter flowing under my fingers.. 4. Camera - I have attatched few sample images where you can really appreciate the amount of detail this beast can capture. 64 MP shots are crystal clear with very level of detail.. Again i am short of words to explain the camera. Simply best camera phone under Rs 20,000. While all other brands keep explaining how you can use pro mode to make it intresting but in this phone you can simply point and shoot and results are always interesting. Also there is pro mode and many other modes if you still need them.. I have become a fan of this phone and a fan of samsung.. No negative points so far , i will keep updating this review in future if i find anthing good or bad.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have bought the order and completing 10 days, I'm not happy with the product , the brand new 6000mah phone drains faster than my old phone which is a 4000mah battery. The battery started to drain faster after installing more apps which was actually after 7 days.. A 20k phone now needs to be serviced in our own efforts to a samsung service center during the lockdown, due to the fact that I have crossed the 7 day cross mark of return period. The Amazon team easily denied the replacement/refund option saying that I have crossed 7days.. The phone has come up with so many bugs even after the software updates.. I would not recommend everyone to not go with this model. The display looks dull though it's amoled type.. Please go for another model n vendor at this price.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Long battery life to sustain for more than one and a half day, responsive fingerprint reader including retinal scan and a great camera to shoot at various angles. The nail in the coffin is that its NON CHINESE and this is the minimum we can do to support the cause in such a situation. Only one demerit is that its slightly heavy, may be due to 6000 mah bty.

Multi tasking and day to day usage, i did not find any problem and it is flawless. Casual gaming, u can do easily but not for heavy gamers. Camera quality is awesum, pics are a little over saturated but i wont complain, it enhances the beauty of the pictures. Battery easily lasts me 1.5 days on heavy usage.

Best available battery life with fast charging. 2. Good audio quality in video recording (for uploading acoustic guitar covers on YouTube). 3. A nice camera. 4. Good enough processor for multitasking. 5. Additional slot for expandable memory. This M31 from Samsung proves great on all fronts as per my requirement.. I am not a pro tech savvy who goes into the minute detail of every feature but would sum up the best I could experience in the last 5 days.. Camera Quality - My wife loved it more than her One plus 6T, pretty unbelievable though. Both front and rear (4 lenses) do their job quite well.. I video recorded a guitar cover and both picture and sound were upto the mark.. Battery life- one full charge lasted around 36 hours on a normal usage. 0-100% charge took around 2.5 hours ~ 150 minutes.. Gaming/Processor - Played Real cricket 20 and Gear club Racing, absolutely smooth.. Feel of the phone - Slightly bulky due to heavy battery but that's okay.. Most features similar to A51 but price almost 8k lower.. For someone like me who doesn't like to spend more than 15k on a phone, this might be the best option for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars

As Said By Samsung itself That It Is a Monster Of a Phone Since It Has Quite a Bit Upgrade when It Comes to Battery And Camera Which is Absolutely True According to my Usage After 1 Week. Pros:-. •Super Amoled Display Which is The best In Market Also better Than most Of The 120Hz Displays I have Used. •6000MaH battery With Gaming And Heavy Usage It Easily Lasts for 1 and 1/2 Days. Even More If I Resort To Lighter Usage Close to 2 Days Then.. •Charger Provided Inside Is a Fast charger That Typically Charges The Monster Battery To 100% in 2 And 1/2 Hours. •Samsung One UI 2.0 Is Very User Friendly And fast While Operating So There Is No Issue with That. •Quad Camera is by Far The best in this Range I Have Used Other Phones In 20k Range But None can Beat These camera Sensors. Portraits are perfect,Macro Camera is Okayish but Overall In this price Range It is the best. •Exynos Processor used In This one is Pretty Fast and Handles multiple Processing Task fluently. •Single handed mode is enabled And Also Full screen mode is Enabled. • Audio output out of this one is Good But Not The best In this Price Range. Cons:-. •Device Sometimes Tend To Heat Up a Little While gaming Coz This Is Not a Gaming Phone Ofcourse But The Ram Management And the Game Booster Given By samsung Manages It Well. Conclusion:-. Overall In this price Range Samsung Has Provided Us with a Beast Phone Irrespective of A little low Gaming Performance but Other than That You dhpuld Totally Go For this Phone If u Want to Watch movies And entertainment on Netflix, Prime and also Want a good user Experience, Battery Life and Camera.

Camera: Great camera, I am not much mobile camera freak but when I used it I found it extremely great in the range..

Sound: Quality of sound is very good whether it is speaker phone or as you can play music aswell and it's enough for a small room.. Screen: It is good, as it's a display and picture quality is great it shows real colours.. Backside: I liked this new material by Samsung which is used in the backside of this phone, as when you hold your phone, you will not feel it slippery and in this range it is great, the only thing I felt is it's backside cover quickly captures the dirt of hand and drops handprints etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars

First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.. Good:. - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!. - Display is excellent with Blue light filter.. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG. - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE. - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.

But I would recommend samsung to add a feature in the camera. We should be able to lock the exposure while recording a video... otherwise any movement causes the exposure to change hence not giving a nice feel to the video.. RAM holds up well. But I feel bad that there is no secure folder or even screen recorder feature. It is there for game launcher but not for anything else.

Biggest issue is about network.Netowrk is not consistent through out so be aware of this.. 1.Fingerprint sensor on back side.It should be on screen or it should be imposed on lock key. 2.Material finishing looks cheaper they have used plastic as compared with other brands.. 3.Charger should be 30W but m31 is with 15w charger as it takes time to charge. 4.In the same price range other brands are giving fastest cpu where as samsung is giving middle class processor to samsung is giving its processor. 5.As it is 10nm technology it reduces battery stand by time while other brands uses 8nm which saves the battery.. 6.Charger and mobile design need to be changed.,4.0 out of 5 stars

It takes really long time to charge. Around more than 1.5 hr to get 100% charged.. 2.

No user manual is provided with the phone nor the sim insertion pin that we get for all the phones these days. Packaging could be much better than this..

Network issue in the system its having always 2 bars and network drainage during my online class..... 2.It having heating issue if you will use this system for 1hr it becomes hot ...I think there is a major problem which I face..... 3. Samsung doesn't provide any case or temper so we have to order or buy from any other place...so I ordered a popiyo glass..that was a duplicate product.

But after using for almost 5 and a half months this phone is giving a lot of trouble. As you can see in my uploaded image, this phone screen is frozen. It happened several times. The phone restarts itself several time and sometime it will be stuck for an entire day. This problem is impacting my work life. I cleared the memory, I removed and uninstalled many apps but still no result. The worst part is that I am trying to get my money back and I requested for a replacement also, but customer care is not at all helping me out for this process. I am facing this issue for the last 20 days..... this is the worst service from Samsung. I feel like cheated. Folks, please think twice before buying this phone.",1.0 out of 5 stars

2192,Reviewed in India on 4 September 2020,Majesty Wishes,After 4 days _ Wish I bought the nord and wish I had something to use if returned this,Good : yes its priced very low for a good amoled screen phone. Bad : the phone heats a lot from the ear piece side and can't even keep it close to ears if used to for more than 15 minutes for calling. Its doesn't exactly fast charge and takea a good 2 hours without use to full charge the phone . But ofcourse its maybe coz its 6000mah. The camera only has big mega pixel numbers but I wouldn't say it's shows visible difference when compared to 16 or 12 mega pixel cameras. A few sudden reboots and weird behaviour such as sounds going on and off of keyboard taps has been observed.,3.0 out of 5 stars

2197,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2020,Mohammed Azharudheen,Amazing buy for this price range,After 5 months of use I am decided I wont recommend samsung handsets to anybody. My phones motherboard got damaged just on the 5th month. Customer service said it is due to a bug while updating the software. Thnak god i had 1 month warranty remaining and got fixed it with no cost. I have to say the processor is very bad that even 10k range innote 1 would beat it. Gameplay is laggy. Even phone gets hang sometimes when you take ut out of pocket and open it using fingerprint. This lag will take upto 10 sec of your time. I raised these issues on customer care but they told me that you should get a phone above 20k inrder to get decent performance! I mean... are you serious?? I have previously used xiom note5 and it was a beast during its time and its just 12k. I lost all hopes for this handset and will go for some one plus handset next time.,2.0 out of 5 stars

The amoled display gives best experience while watching movies. Also the battery is 6000 mAh battery which last for 2 days minimum. This is a good package deals in recent smartphones and the mobile is manufactured in India ❤️.

This is the best,I've used this product for nearly 10 days and now I'll share its Pros and Cons.. Pros. 1) It has a great battery life.. 2) The display is bright and rich in details.. 3) Camera is very good (But i would say one of the best in this price segment).. 4) Sound output is good.. 5) Overall design is good sleek and light weight.. 6) Samsung UI's user experince is easy and stutter free.. Cons. 1) The phone seems to be a little slippery.. 2) Gets warm while playing heavy graphics games Pubg or pes ( was a bit disappointed). But it's Kay when you keep the settings under balanced or medium graphics. Not recommended for heavy gamers.. 3) Plastic body doesn't give a classy look.. 4) Charging speed is very slow (But you have to accept it for the bigger battery size). Takes approx 2.5 hours for 0-100%.,4.0 out of 5 stars
2204,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2020,Aman Gupta,Monster battery and Amazing display,Firstly and most importantly the battery in this phone is literally a monster and easily lasts 1.5 days even fpr heavy users and 2 days easily for moderate users but since the battery is 6000mah it takes more than 2 hours to charge it completely but then again you wont need to charge it daily.. The phone feels sturdy in hand though the back is plastic and will need some protection from scratches and fingerprints. The camera is decent along with macro lens and portrait mode. The biometrics are little slow sometimes fail to detect specially the facial recognition unlock. The display is crisp and tough is up-tp mark.. Overall a recommended phone who prefer a looong lasting battery over other things.,4.0 out of 5 stars
2205,Reviewed in India on 19 March 2020,Raja Mukherjee,Excellent option at cheapest price in the range!,Though I was apprehensive to buy this phone after using my previous One Plus 5 for the last 3 yrs yet I must say that this by far the best decision I have made in the month! #M31 is a monster rightly as highlighted in their ads constantly. Few of my friends were chosen to give the first reviews and I am glad I believed them!. The 64 mega pixel camera is fantastic and has a good AI attached to it because it can differ food objects and nature pretty vividly. The finger print sensor at the back is quickest indeed. And the battery life is super amazing too. Though the charging scene is a bit slow but it's okay to give that time off to the phone once in two days.. I chose the 128 Gb option since I have a bundles of data to carry and the phone is clearly standing up to my expectations in the last 10 days.,5.0 out of 5 stars

But, overall the phone is absolute value for money. I would like to add a few cons, which I think should be taken into consideration while buying this:. 1. No dash charging. Having used One Plus for quite a long, charging the phone becomes a bit painful for me. It takes close to 3 hrs to fully charged from zero. But, having a 6000 mah battery, it takes a lot to time to get drained as well. I was able to use this phone more than 24 hours on a single charge with quite heavy usage and screen time.. 2.

2228,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2020,Amrita J.,Detalied Review,"I have been using this phone since April and i can say that this phone is not meant for gamers at all, the camera quality is satisfying, better than most of the mid range devices, battery life is as good as it has been promised altough it takes a lot of time to charge its 15W charger takes at least 2.5 hrs to charge from 0 to 100 if not more, the processor is not that good, if you're playing a game(suppose PUBG mobile) the game lags, moreover there are some glitches that needs to be fixed for example sometimes the keyboard will freeze and not respond, It'd good if Samsung tries to fix that in near future.. The cover also gets dirty easliy(dk why) finger print, smudges are visible on the back cover for the space black model.. Overall Pros. 1. SAMOLED display. 2. Battery life. 3. Camera. Cons. 1. Processor. 2. Charging time(its irritating). 3. Some glitches. 4. Sometimes it gets heated up on heavy use, though not much( talking abt the screen near the camera). I hope future buyers will find it helpful. 5. Speaker not that loud",4.0 out of 5 stars

2230,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,Samar chauhan,Moster in hands,Its a great phone and everything is just monsterous but one thing that i find bad about this phone is that the phone has plastic back which takes lots of fingerprints and thus problems somrthimes on fingerprint senser also...other than that the camera is just amazing but it doesnt have night mode but in day light its fab. Its display is super good because even if you have bad network connection and cant play videos in higher setting you can watch it in lower setting but because of screen it will give you an mosterous effect. The battery is the major high light of this phone if you have more than 90% battery you can use it whole day without any pause but then also you will find some percent left in the battery bank..

2231,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2020,Preetam Mohapatra,After 5 days of use,M ok with it didn’t make up to the expectation. Camera quality ok. Battery life on single sim with very very minimum usage or no use at all last for max 1 and Half day. Inbuilt app lock not available. Inbuilt screen recording not available. Though these r not a big issue or a deal breaker. Overall good phone for basic daily use. Not much for youngsters. In hand feel of the phone is slightly on the bulkier side. May be due to a massive battery. Display quality is awesome. Speaker output is also ok. Fingerprint sensor works absolutely fine,3.0 out of 5 stars
2232,Reviewed in India on 6 September 2020,Vaibhav Vishal,Not as good as I expected,"Update: The software Samsung has provided is the most annoying ever. Everytime I get a software update, they will installed 5-10 third party apps on my phone automatically. Worse than ads, at least you can skip then, here Samsung directly installs the apps on your phone. Very cheap way of making money, I already paid for the phone, Samsung shouldn't in-built these things in the software to make more money.. Changing my rating to 1 Star, will switch to a different company's phone soon.. Face unlock: Slow af, won't recognise you half the time, so basically unusable.. Fingerprint unlock: is faster than face unlock, but you need to cover the whole fingerprint reader with your finger, and the reader is unnecessarily big so it's hard to cover it completely sometimes.. Battery life: lasts one whole day easily. But my old phone used to last whole day too and it had a much smaller battery.. Camera quality: Good for a phone in this price range.",1.0 out of 5 stars
2233,Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Gaurav ,The best phone within 20000,Performance wise the phone is very good. Touch and fingerprint lock works within fraction of seconds. I had always been a BlackBerry fan for almost 10 years but switched to Samsung and am very satisfied with it. At 17000 rupees there couldn't be any better mobile than this.. Battery life - 6000 mah battery has got you extra life if you keep your mobile data off then battery doesn't go down 20 in 70 hours. With all function enabled 1 35-40 hours you need to recharge..

Sometimes I have to try 3-4 times to unlock the phone. It has some problems with the network connectivity also. Same service provider network works fine in another phone but is slow on M31.

There are both ups and downs to this device like this has an amazing battery but it takes time to completely charge it, which is obvious considering its size. The display is beautiful to look at, the colours are vibrant and it gets extremely bright. But the back is plastic which feels cheap. The phone comes with a proper fast charger in the box but misses out on a phone case. The cameras on the phone are nothing to brag about, they are alright at this price point.. To summarise this is a great phone with a few bits of cost saving here and there, which is to be expected at this price point. But the goods far outweigh the little bads which can be neglected.

2273,Reviewed in India on 10 April 2021,vivek sahi,Great battery life!,"I had stopped using Samsung because of the bloatware and all the rubbish that comes with it, however I needed a phone with a good battery life, and I found that in the M31. I use it as a work phone and with mobile data on 24/7 its used alot, for mails, messages and concalls, despite the heavy duty use the battery easily lasts and requires a recharge every 2 days, I don`t care about the camera as I hardly use it. If you require a phone for heavy use, and your priority is a long battery life then go for this phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The weight is also low as compared to many other handsets with same screen size. I have not used the camera, hence cannot comment about it.. About battery. I charge in the morning to 100%. But by next morning, it is drained to just 30-32%. Secondly, many unwanted apps are pre-installed which are taking the space. I am unable to have the clock on the screen.

I'm not a cover fan though, I like the phone the way it is.. Features:. Fast Charging. Android 10 One UI2. Memory Card slot. Best - 3.5 mm Audio Jack. Dolby Atmos sound. 6000 mAh - more than 48 hours with moderate usage and about day and half with extreme usage. Charting time is about 30-45 minutes. NO ADs - The best part. Sound: Quite loud, over calls as well on speaker side. That's what I love. To be honest, I was so worried about transferring the data from old phone to new one, but found out the Samsung Smart switch app, within minutes every single thing(means everything) from old phone to new got transferred, absolutely had nothing else to do apart from installing the apps.. Assistant is also quite nice.. For me some things were hard to find in the new UI as I was used to other versions, but it has everything that other smartphones are offering and even better than others in the same price segment. Samsung Members is the place I found to be very helpful if anyone has any questions or issues to be discussed about the phone.. The only thing that didnt impress me is the Dialer, its split in 3 parts (Keypad/Recent/Contacts), maybe i'm used to the one page Dialer thats why.. Also the Notification menu, its quite big, I think considering the phone size its designed this way by Samsung.. I'm glad I chose a great birthday gift for myself, I sure am satisfied with the product. Thanks",5.0 out of 5 stars

I mainly use my phone for day to day calling, texting, light reading (comics), watch movies, and take pictures of documents and landscape. some times in full-screen mode while watching movies in chrome, the video gets stuck which will resume after minimizing and reopening the app. The camera is cool with high resolution but the images taken through the wide-angle lens have lacked that resolution. Nigh mode photos are also good. But sometimes I think the phone is not making good use of the 6GB ram. The Samsung store apps are filled with ads which are annoying. face unlock doesn't work well in low light. Overall it is snappy and elegant.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2323,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2020,cp s.,Go for it,"Talking about Samsung Galaxy M31, it is an amazing phone to spend money on. Some people say that Samsung has been using the same processor in most of its mobile ranges, but it seems to be best as per my opinion, as Qualcomm Snapdragon has been recently accused for stealing data, and on the other side, Mediatek Processors lack on remaining cool. So, I focused on the point on which the wishing buyers change the mind, and I did not highlight points about camera which is seemingly amazing, display which is bright and sharp and battery which is gigantic, because everyone get attracted to it, but after knowing the processor, they usually change their decision.. Conclusion: It is a nice phone for daily usage and you should go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

2327,Reviewed in India on 13 March 2020,SAMINA KHAN,Gives others a run for their money. Worth more than the price!,"I bought this the day it launched. The very moment it was available for sale and got it at an affordable price of ₹14999, delivered the same day via Amazon Prime. Its been almost 15 days of heavy use now. What i liked:. -Amoled screen is sharp and crisp at displaying. No faulty viewing angles. Drop notch is super stylish and gives a flagship look to the device. Videos can be cropped to fit by the finger pinching out action. i have never seen Adaptive Brightness work so well in any phone.. -Fingerprint sensor is easy to reach at the back below the camera. Quick unlocking and Smart Unlock works well. Face unlock is accurate and works well too.. -Quad Camera setup is one of the sleekest cameras and positioning looks fabulous. The camera is quick to focus, great depth, the 64MP produces sharp images with a focus on the smallest details too. It has features like Pro, Hyperlapse, SlowMo, SuperSlowMo, Panorama, Night mode, Macro (wide), Bixby Vision, AR emoji, Food, 4k video and so much more. The front camera is better than what it looks like. It has perfect positioning, quick to focus and great attention to detail too. Overall, the cameras themselves make this phone worth a buy. Not just better in this range of phones but also than most flagship phones in 40-50k range.. -Android 10 & One UI2.1 are both very clean, precise and extremely easy to use. If you're on any os below 9, this will be a great upgrade.. -The biggest reason i bought this was the 6000mAh monster battery, it is not surprising that they do deliver their promise in this case too. The battery does not exhaust easily. Being a heavy user this battery, after charged fully, lasts around 2.5 days for me. The 15W type C charger that comes in the box takes about an hour to charge it from 0 to 100%.. -There is one external speaker towards the side of the charging port which produces clean and moderately loud sound. Dolby Atmos Sound is also an upgrade if you are looking for a surround sound experience. towards the other side of the charging port, you have a 3.5mm headphone jack.. -The Samsung Exynos 9611 processor lives upto its name. It is faster than i had expected it to be. Also, there are separate slots for memory and 2 sim cards which is a major pro.. -The phone in hand feels very light, despite its huge battery. The Ocean Blue colour looks sophisticated and might give the black variant competition.. -The box has a 15W fast charger with cable, user manuals, ejection pin.. What I didn't like. -It might sound stupid but there is nothing that i did not like about the m31. Maybe they could have provided a headphone in the box but given the features of the phone at such a low price range, that is understandable. Other than that, the phone has delivered to all the claims that it made and I think it is one of the best phones i have owned so far. Great competition in this range. Highly Recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The photos speak for there selves but focus is not available in macro mode you have to make exact distance about 3cms to clearly have a nice shot, the night mode is very good. When you open Slow motion videos, you fell lag on the videos. I think it is a software problem because i have seen m30s capturing good slow motion videos by having exactly the same proccer, I hope samsung will solve this problem in future updates.. when we came to the front camera, i think samsung tried to improve the front camera from m30s. It is very great but suffers a little at night time.. 2.BATTERY. The 6000mah battery on this device is excellent, it last easly 2 days with moderete users. And can last a full day with heavy users so no need to worry about the battery.. 3.DISPLAY. Perfect, no problem with that.. 4.VALUE FOR MONEY. the best from devices in this price segment.. 5.FINGER PRINT AND FACE UNLOCK. finger print is fast and secure, i have no problem with that. Face unlock is very fast during a day. But doesn't work sometimes at night and artificial light sources.. PROS. 1.BIG BATTERY. 2.AWESOME DISPLAY. 3.GREAT CAMERA. 4.FAST FINGER PRINT SCANNER.

Processor is very fast, as you can open up 4-5 apps in pop up window and the phone dosen't even lag a bit, not to mention gaming- smoothest gameplay you could ever get in this price range.. All that aside the best feature is its battery backup, with a full charge your phone will easily last about 2-3 days over its normal day to day usage.. Fast charging dosen't satisfy much as it takes around 2 hours to charge from 30-100%.. If you're ordering online, make sure to add to cart a tampered glass and back cover along with it, as these are not included in the box, also make sure its of good quality becausethe glass may brake if the phone hits the ground with the corner side.. In short, its an awesome phone and you'll definitely love it...",4.0 out of 5 stars

At this price range if there is a phone to suggest this would be the one .. The camera is decent not very good if we compare it to High end phones. But it is good if we compare it with any other under 20k phone.. About the battery, it is very nice. The battery is huge like I use it for the whole day without charging it and yet there is some battery left.. Gaming experience is decent not so good but definitely not bad. I play PUBG on this device and performs pretty very well.. Moreover the built quality is good and also looks good when someone notices it .",5.0 out of 5 stars

Moved from an Iphone 7 (poor signal reception, disappointing battery life). Super AMOLED display is very engaging, (reading books is comfortable, even in dim light) 6000 mAh battery, powerful camera (miss the OIS though). Only complaint is the processor, which can get overwhelmed at times. Keep in mind the form factor, this one can get quite large with a case on it. Most importantly, the SAR value is low (around 0.3 Head SAR). Overall, extremely happy with the purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Prior to this I was using Moto G5 plus, which is also quite good in terms of camera quality. But this phone also offers a live focus feature. You can see the images for yourself to judge.. 3. The look of the phone is quite sleek. No issues at all.. Some things that can be improved:. 1. The layout of the keypad can be improved to make it a little broader.. No other issues at all.

The thing I didn't like is it takes upto 2 and a half hours to charge. The other one I didn't like is its GPU. It is the oldest GPU of Mali and the performance is not as much good.

Samsung's M31's photos are more lively and provide you natural element of the clicking environment.. 2. Battery Life. It takes upto 2-2.5 Hrs to fully charge the phone and you can use the phone for almost whole day. whole day because at the time of writing this review Lockdown is going on India due to Corornavirus, so i am always watching Videos and surfing Instagram and Facebook in it.. 3. Amoled screen - gives you amazing experience with Videos and movies.. Cons:. 1. Not for Gaming - Since i am not gamer, this device perfectly suits my needs. But If you are interested in playing games i would suggest to go with other devices.. 2. Charger - Should have given more powerful charger since 6000mah takes alot of time to charge the device with the provided charger.. 3. Back of the phone does not feel premium.

I got the phone fallen down from my hand and the build quality is too weak. the frame and screen , both broke.. 5. The parts are not even available in service centers.. 6.Has manyyy number of bugs, camera in whatsapp does not open at once. The accidental touch protection will get on in such a way that it will lock the phone for hours. Overall, my worst experience with samsung devices, they 2019s Samsung A50 aldo performed much well.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung customer service and support is very good.since they have enormous number of service centres.. 3. The phone is very impressive in terms of looks.. 4. The battery is 6000mah which means you can stop worrying about the battery to drain fast..

As far as screen is concerned super Amoled display with pixel density of 443 is best in class.I've been using the phone for about 4 days now and the phone works smoothly.The fingerprint sensor is fast.No heating problems detected so far PUBG works seamlessly in the ultra HD mode.I charged the phone to a 100% and then used the phone for about 45 min,to my surprise the battery was drained just to 1%..

Amazing battery life, even after using Netflix + PUBG + Always on display for 5 hours, saw only 50% battery drain.. 2. Amoled screen has very good color saturation.. 3. Camera is good enough for my purposes, got decent night time pics.. Caveats: 1. You have to select ""natural"" in the color saturation options, vivid is quite extreme. 2. The default camera setting is 16 MP. You need to explicitly select 64MP as an aspect ratio (?!!) in the camera settings.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Below are the issues i faced till now . I think these issues are specific to my mobile as these are basic for any mobile and no one mentioned these points in reviews .. 1. Call waiting is not working.. When i am on call and if someone calls to the same number, then i am NOT getting any sound/display.. It says my mobile is switched off for other end person..... I could see ""call waiting "" option is enabled in Phone icon -> Settings -> Supplementary Services -> Call Waiting to enable , but still it is not working.. THIS IS VERY BASIC TESTING FOR ANY MOBILE.. For a company like Samsung, they should do basic testing for each mobile. 2. when phone is locked , call cut is not working sometimes.. 3. Unable to dismiss alarm when phone is locked. This is also very basic testing. Dismiss alarm is not working when it is locked.. If i unlock my phone to dismiss alarm , it is going to snooze state and i needed to cancel the alarm by going to alarm page.. I didn't get much time to test my phone , i think it may have lot of issues .. Unfortunately Return window closed on 27-Oct-2020.. I will call to samsung customer care and update",1.0 out of 5 stars

Even the 32 megapixel front facing camera is beyond my imagination. It is the best phone under 15000 rupees.

No Lag, so pretty good processor (not a gamer). 3. Awesome display.. 4. Powerful Andriod 10 features and samsung UI.. 5. Fast fingerprint display (Dont want to use face unlock and in display fingerprint). Cons:. 1. A bit heating while using camera or other heavy apps (may be I felt coming from iphone) but not much while charging. Negligible factor I would say.. 2. A bit heavy (again coming from iphone). 3. Low light photography isn't that good.. 4. Call volume and speaker volume not sufficient.. 5. Charging a bit slow..

Oh and this phone probably has the best screen under 20k I haven't seen the other phones but this one is an one of a kind.

2437,Reviewed in India on 2 September 2020,Raju K.,LTE/4G signals are not getting,Getting E or Extended network and not getting LTE/4G signals in the phone. Tried Airtel/Vodafone/Jio sim cards all of them are showing E network. Fortunately same sim cards when used in other phone I am getting LTE/4G network. Visited the Airtel/Vodafone/Jio stores and they confirmed no issues with the sim card as well as network. Finally visited Samsung service center they tried to update software tried all different settings but the problem remains same. Finally I have raised concern with seller today. Is there anyone facing similar issue with this phone and how did you resolved the issue?,1.0 out of 5 stars

2439,Reviewed in India on 27 March 2020,Aaskane B. C. Dogra,A must take it and one of the bestest smartphone on its price cap,Before m31 I have m30s which is one of the best smartphone coming up at that range. Now as the upgradation move on m31. The camera quality with quad 64 MP rear camera comes with different modes is amazing and spiced up with Bixby vision you can click pictures that hard to differentiate from HD wallpapers. With the 6000 mAh battery can endures your smartphone processes for as long as 1 day of continuous activity (non gaming) Fingerprint is perfectly sensitive and better than compare to m30s. 6 GB RAM can provide perfect speed throughout the running apps. Best part about it sAmoled screen is one of the best features that make it different from other phones the colour quality because of that is completely amazing and on top of that while comparing it to iPhone 8 screen for sure samsung going to win over.,5.0 out of 5 stars
2440,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,retr0,Best replacement for all mid-range Chinese smartphones,"At first I was a bit skeptic, with Exynos processors but this Exynos 9611 is really good. Images are sharp and Vivid. Maco is also good. Battery usually last 1-1.5 days on average usage, which includes Streaming songs, videos, and attending online meetings also. Network perception is really great. And the screen as you know its sAMOLED it is really great. Dolby Atmos is is pretty awesome when paired up with a decent earphone.. And its UI is also really good, unlike any other smartphone brands you do not receive any unnecessary Ads and pop-ups.. It is almost good as the Stock Android.. As of now the recent security patch is of July.. So I think security updates is also good.. If you are a binge watcher like me, it's an ideal phone for you from Samsung.. Or if you are average user who looking for a non-Chinese phone, it is the phone you would really appreciate.. And this phone is manufactured in India, so it does support Make in India.. Till now I have no regrets after buying this device.. Previously I had Asus Zenfone Pro M1, it is really great and I loved stock Android.. So there are very few bloatwares, most of them can be uninstalled or can be hidden.. In fact I recommended this phone to some of my friends and they really loved it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

2442,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Sahil,Decent budget buy,"The phone itself is pretty robust, dropped it already but it's fine except for a dent or two on the Gorilla Glass back panel. Would still recommend using a cover, no screen guard needed though.. The battery is, as expected, enough even if you're using it all day with continuous WiFi and Bluetooth connections playing videos or games.. Great screen with a bright display and high sensitivity (can be adjusted in the settings).. Fingerprint sensor in the back is also responsive and blends into the back well.. The cameras are also good, have tried all the features yet and have found no complains.. The performance for daily application is more than adequate, I can keep a taxing game open and use Spotify in the background with some chrome tabs plus texting too.. 10 month update:. Phone screen shattered once without cover after falling on a tar road and cracked once after repair with a cover.. Glastic body has numerous scratches and is disappointing to say the least.. Camera still holding up good and is probably the best thing besides the battery.",5.0 out of 5 stars

However, just like with other similar phones, a large size is unavoidable for a better display of media (video, text, etc).

Great battery- I used this phone for 5 days without charging it, also I don't have any simcard on the phone.. Camera is excellent. Super amoled display is good.. I miss 3 finger screenshot that were on redmi.Also I don't like it's palm screenshot but I like its multiple page screenshot.. I also miss seeing data speed.. Lastly i can say it's processor is far better than my redmi note 4.. Overall 4 stars because I miss taking easy screenshot( i'm a student) and miss seeing data speed.

2486,Reviewed in India on 10 March 2020,Muthukrishnan Gurusamy,Awesome phone for this price,"For office goers , home makers, I would say this is the best phone with best specification from a well known brand. I am writing this review after 5 days of decent use. Battery can survive for 2 days easily even with decent data usage. No heating issue. 64 MP Camera and video quality is so good like a flagship phone. Without a cover, the phone is too slippery to handle. Wide angle camera quality is okay but I don't use it frequently so it is not a big compromise. Selfie camera with 32 MP is a good trade off. No lag or delay in graphics, the transition is too smooth. Gorilla glass 3.0 is very helpful. Speaker sound and quality is very decent enough. Great Audio quality while using this M31 with bluetooth headset especially with ""Dolby Atmos"" effect on, which I didn't expect. I was planning to buy M30S, but after knowing the launch of M31, I was waiting for 15 days to book this one. Having a 64 MP camera phone would definitely need a 128 GB storage to store your beautiful memories. Worth buying, go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2487,Reviewed in India on 1 June 2020,niveditha k.,Heat issues ... Do not recommend this phone,"Cons:. Heats up a lot :. The phone heats up a lot along the upper body during charging and gradually the entire display gets heated up . you wont be able to make calls on the phone just after unplugging due to excessive heat.. RAM usage :. Phone after factory reset with no apps running consumes whooping 3GB RAM . So the 6GB RAM is a MYTH. You hardly get 2GB of RAM space for your applications .. Memory : Out of the 64GB of memory , the system UI and OS takes a whopping 12GB of memory space .. Pros:. Camera is decent and Fingerpint access is quite smooth..

I did not pay 16000 rs for you to send me your promotional apps in system update.. And come on Samsung! There is no calculator in your system apps. Why don't you update that instead?

Moreover, the phone feels lightweight as a feather despite packing in a 6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging, which charges this battery in about 2 hours. The display is the best part of the phone. Extremely gorgeous display with a small notch. Moreover, the quad camera array at the back houses an 64 MP camera, which gives extremely detailed photos. The 8MP ultrawide and the Macro camera also are the best in this price bracket. I am exceptionally happy to upgrade from my old phone to this one, and I would recommend it to someone who is a causal gamer and wants a phone with a big battery, great display and awesome cameras.

2532,Reviewed in India on 29 May 2020,Amazon Customer,A Great Buy,"The Samsung M31 is a power packed performer not only among it's equivalent price range smartphones but comparative to all high end phones available in the market today.. 1. Overall Handling is quite satisfying. With an Amoled Screen and a good resolution perfect for binge watching. You can switch between Vivid and Natural colours though (don't know why it comes in vivid default).. 2. Has a 64 MP rear camera with ultra wide and depth however as anyone would have a nick for wanting the best, there still is room for improvement.. 3. Comes with Face recognition and Finger print scanner, however there is a fraction of a second's lag while unlocking the phone. Recognition does get better with more use.. 4. Has an inbuilt Optimiser in the UI with anti-theft features to clear up memory,check battery usage and scan through an inbuilt antivirus. So that is an addition, however a third party antivirus should still be used as back up.. 5. The smartphone boasts of a 6000mAH mega battery and it lives up to the figure with 9-10 hrs of battery if used continuously and upto 2 days with normal to minimal use(Frankly speaking I gifted the phone to my mother and was surprised to see it working at 28%, the day after it was charged..also it was charged in the evening around 5 pm...so still not 2 days). The Charger supports fast charging but I wouldn't compare it to One Plus' dash charging as it would take upto 150 mins to reach full charge on M31.. Eventually I did want to buy one more for myself,but there already is one M31 in the family.. A great buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

A great camera, a long lasting battery and an awesome display are the main features of the phone in my opinion. It does fall a bit backward in processing capabilities as compared to some other phones in the mid range , but as I don't game a lot of mobile , I really didn't see this as an issue. The phone may not be able to play games such as PUBG in high settings , but once the graphics is lowered it should handle it no problem. As for the other features the charging does take a considerable amount of time but it is expected as a huge 6000 mah battery is given which last for well over a day even with my extreme usage.. I would say go for it. It is one of the best mid rangers in the market and definitely one if the best ones that samsung have released in recent times.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought it a month ago and have been experiencing utter pain of choosing it over many options available. The only thing good is display rather everything is below average. It doesn't give the best of performances though it has 6000 mah but its worthless and almost like 4500 mah. 64 mps is a joke. I don't play pubg over it. Just a game of PES 2020 is what I have been playing over it on wifi and such a disgrace that this phone makes me loose many a times due to it's lag. It has made me such irritable that I chose to call quits and uninstall it. It's not a very high graphic game like pubg. The hype of this phone is too much for the taking and should be reviewed by everyone so that such smartphones with only just promises but no deliverance is stopped from being designed and launched.

Camera seems to be a decent one though haven't used it much. Sometimes fingerprint reader seems unresponsive. However a worthy budget phone.. Xiaomi Motorola offering 30W Charger and better processor/GPU in similar cost which I think Samsung should really think upon.. One of the feature which gives premium look to the device is Always On Display. One UI is better then others customized Andriods, however adding an option to customize the launcher would be a another great addition, I believe Stock Andriod launcher is the best, giving an option for vertical drawer will make UI complete.",4.0 out of 5 stars

What could have been better:. - Newer chipset although I haven't seen any lag in any normal tasks thanks to the great optimization done by Samsung folks.. - Battery charging time is a little high as the battery capacity is very hugh despite the 15W fast charging capacity..

Am writing after the struggle of 1 year and lost the trust with biggest manufacturer. It's not worth to deal with this manufacturer anymore in life for any other products too.. Bought during the lock down period in Mar 2020. Within a month got corrupted and showing only restart screen. After following over customer care for a month no progress just to transferring the calls to next levels and got disconnected after waiting for a hour.. Then after few relaxation went to service center in May 2020 and checked and found mother board got failed and repaired it taking a month time.. Now exactly less than 10 months same issue as attached in the picture. No progress but claiming that now warranty period end by Mar 2021 and they are not responsible for that and I have to pay and it still in trouble shooting status to find the failed part... Let's expect some response from manufacturer it they are already a human being or no response if something else... Please don't buy this product...,5.0 out of 5 stars

There is this notion that it EXYNOS 9611 is laggy, wifi reception is not good, battery is not 6000, camera quality is better than MI note 8 pro...etc..But it's not.. Camera's image processing is lot more efficient than the 8 pro's MEDIATEK HELIO G90T which is d most powerful processor. Night images are also good..

2628,Reviewed in India on 28 June 2020,Debjyoti Das,Initially it's awesome but within 1 year it's the worst experience,"Writting this review after 12 days of usage. So let's start with unboxing it. Just when you open the box and touch the phone you will feel the premium handset.. Next display, it's a full HD+ super Amoled display with stunning colourful looks that soothes your eyes.. Now come to the important point, battery backup, it's a 6000 mah battery designed to last at least 3 to 4 days (it lasted 5 days also) with normal usage but no gaming or little internet download. Now if you are a heavy user, then this phone will give you 1 to 2 days battery backup. Actually myself sometimes forget when did I charge my phone last time.. Now processor, it's Exynos 9611 with 2.3 GHz primary clock frequency & 1.7 GHz secondary clock frequency gives excellent processing speed, you can play PUBG also, but may not be in high definition. But still I say it runs game superb.. Now the awesome 64 MP quad rear camera with LED flash, Auto focus, AI mode, beautification & 32 MP front camera with screen flash just makes your pictures look even more beautiful than you can expect.. Finally Samsung offering Android 10 with super graphics experience that you will fall in love with it.. The only thing is that Samsung need to switch to Snapdragon or Kirin processor though Exynos series are now competing with those two easily I think.. I bought the 6GB RAM & 64 GB storage model with price Rs. 15999/-. I suggest everyone to go for it without hesitation, but follow my price which I mentioned above.. It's an awesome, brilliant, superb, excellent, wonderful, stunning mobile with a premium look. Actually my adjectives are running short to describe the model.. Just too good...just wow...... 💖😍❤️💙💜. Now my phone has started to hang. And it's hanging dangerously so that I will have to visit Samsung service center. One year is not over yet but the phone is having some dangerous issue. A request all of you not to buy this phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I Zen percent believe that I made the best choice. Because I am already well experienced about the quality, battery life etc... of the Samsung company. I got my phone last week, but I didn't started to use it yet because of its cuteness. Thank you Samsung for presenting such a best phone satisfying all features at affordable price for a middle class person like me. Thank you so much….",5.0 out of 5 stars

2672,Reviewed in India on 12 August 2020,Mahesh,Budget phone / m31,Well.. The battery is neither a bull nor a horse. It is just adequate to power such a heavily loaded machine. Will power a day and half max. Mind it I don't use mobile games. Bummer!. Had network drop couple times. Not sure yet if it's my tower or recipient tower issue.. Am changing mobile after four years. So this m31 fitted well within budget and expectations. Got good exchange for my redmi note 4.. Overall shopping and delivery was great.. 128 GB is a great help. Also dedicated memory card slot. Wow.. Final verdict. For the 12500₹ I spent after exchange and discount for 6/128 model m31 makes me smile. Thanks.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I got a great deal on prime sale 6Gb/64Gb for 12K which is great value for money for s-Amoled phone.. Though back side build quality is not glass or top-notch & will scratch without a cover, but it is not very heavy & fits well with transparent case.. Battery lasts more than a day despite high youtube or video usage around 6hrs & as long as you keep charging before the battery drops to 30% it is quiet decently fast despite being 15W fast charger..

Such is the quality of Samsung phone these days. Now the phone shows let's go and stays idle and that too just after 3 months of purchase. I was trying to upload a video of it .. But some problem with the Amazon as they do not want anybody to see the actual things that happens to the products.

It's sleek design is very nice. Fingerprint reader functions nicely. Camera quality is also great, however I have not experienced it's full feature, but 64MP camera really gives real type feeling.

2696,Reviewed in India on 10 September 2020,Subzod,Honest Review.,"Samsung M31, a nice and decent mobile.. Front Camera - Amazing.. Rear Camera - Fantastic. (Those who are giving bad reviews about both cameras, they dont know how to use a mobile camera. Dont listen to those one star reviews). Battery - Monster. (My phone screen remains on during my office time and I am an heavy user. And in the end of the day, it still left with 45- 50% battery) So if battery is your concern, go for it. It won't disappoint you.. Yes it's multitasking is really good but if you want this for gaming purpose, my friends, you will be disappointed. As i was using Redmi Note 6 Pro before this and I play Mortal Kombat all day. It was not lagging on that phone but on this phone its kind of lagging. Clash Royal - Yes it's lagging.. Real Racing 3 -Yes its lagging.. But at this price range a good processor would be appreciated.. Overall, its a good phone with average processor but with good cameras.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2699,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Saiteja,Great phone. It is worth buying it.,"It has been nearly 4 months since I purchased this phone and never has it shown any sign of problem. The battery life of this phone is extraordinary which easily lasts a day and half with heavy usage and two days easily normally. Many products make false claims but samsung has clearly kept its word in this aspect. Due this factor, the phone may seem heavy but when it is compared to other smartphones which have the same battery life, M31 is a clear winner. The camera quality of the 64 MP rear camera is also too good with sufficient quality and to some extent. The night mode feature and the macro mode feature is the best on this phone. The 32 MP selfie camera is also really good for a budget phone where the image is visible in detail.. Coming to the fingerprint reader, recognition is satisfactory with standard reaction time. Like any other phone which has finger print reader, this phone too doesn't recognize when your hands are moist.. The two features this phone can improve on is the face recognition which is surprisingly poor for a samsung phone and the sound quality. The sound quality is not too less or too loud either.. To sum up the samsung m31 is a really great phone and it comes with a lot of great features for this price. I guarantee that it is definitely worth your money and a cool phone to have. I would give this phone a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Processing:Average.This is not a gaming phone. Memory:128gb is down to 120 gb since system takes 8gb.6gb ram makes daily tasks a breeze but in heavy usage there is some stuttering.overall its a good midrange phone and the best one for the price tag.. Finger print reader is fast. Face recognition is decent.,4.0 out of 5 stars
2718,Reviewed in India on 29 May 2020,ritesh singh,Disappointing Product,"disappointed.. Battery is big but useless. My phone dint last even for whole daytime with full charge with normal uses.. Camera is below par. You could get better camera in less adevertized phones.. The biggest negative is its microphone and speakers. I had to return the phone because of it. Very low sound output and microphone is horrible.. Though the phone has super amoled screen, the colours looks like you are watching a CRT monitor TV.. So Disappointing that I dint even use the phone for 2 days and returned.. Never reccomend it to anyone.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I like this phone, it's working smooth like butter, it's camera, battery, processor are great and it is handling multitasking pretty well, it has great battery backup too. I am not a pro gamer so for me it's more than sufficient for daily working.. The only cons with this phone is that it is not having folder lock or app lock feature. To get his feature, we have to install third party app. Providing folder lock in this phone would have added more security features for users.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Checked with Samsung care they are saying there is issue with motherboard, battery, charging board etc. And cost would be around 9500.

2775,Reviewed in India on 18 October 2020,Anandhu,monster for sure,"This phone was a major update for me from my previous phone which was Honor 8x. Amoled display is my favourite part. And not to forget about the 6000mAh battery that gives us a feeling of worth the money we spent on this phone. The only drawback is that the phone's back panel becomes dirty, especially the rear camera panel, which makes us feel quite uncomfortable, but thats not a big deal if you purchase a back cover . Another drawback might be that we do not get headphones or a back cover with this phone which most of the phones at this price range provides. Well ,spend some 1000rs more on back cover ,temper glass and headphones, you're gonna love this phone for sure.",5.0 out of 5 stars

And i believe, this phone is a good choice for that. With 7-8hours of online meeting and multiple background applications and scanning and other to-dos, the battery lasts around 20 hours minimum. And day offs or OTT apps consume lesser of the battery. The google keyboard hung quite a few times but we all have learnt the patience game. Worth a buy.

It has a very fast finger print sensor at a good location; making it very comfortable to almost everyone.. 3.It has very good camera (64mp which is just outstanding!!), but the only down side is that ar emoji is not very good and it is kind of disturbing to look at it.. I conclude that the, phone is fabulous and wonderful, the hardware is excellent but the software needs thorough improvement, this is because of things like Bixby, AR emoji, sound problems etc..

Audio quality using headphones gives you a different experience altogether.. Battery life lasts for 48-72 hours, if you are a regular user.

The quad rear camera and the front camera of the Samsung M31 captures some good shots although there are some issues during the the low light especially with the front camera. You would probably enjoy using the Bixby vision and the Live Focus feature of the camera. The Super AMOLED FHD+ display does gives you awesome bright feel.

Autofocus is not so quick as well. 32 MP front camera is a beast!!!. The smoothness of display and screen is highly appreciable and commendable and this will be the best in this price range.. Finger print reader should have been onscreen and the case could be ceramic or metalic which are being offered by other manufacturers for this price or lower..

2796,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2020,mohan krishna,Awesome,"The Samsung Galaxy M31 is decently and simply designed when it comes to budget smartphones. There isn’t too much going on but whatever we have on our plates is still eye-pleasing. When I first held the Galaxy M31, it appeared quite bulky. But as it adjusted to my hands I got to know it was lightweight after all. Made up of polycarbonate, the device comes in two colour options: Ocean Blue and Space Black. I got hold of the black colour and loved the classic black tone of the device, which can never go wrong for a smartphone or anything painted in black. Although the smartphone doesn’t have a glass back, it doesn’t come last in the design race and offers us a sleek, not-so-cheap, and sturdy design.. The Samsung Galaxy M31 has a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display, which is known as the Infinity-U display. The name arises from the presence of a waterdrop notch. It is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is slightly disappointing. The smartphone has a number of display features, which are mostly in the case of every Samsung smartphone. There is Adaptive Brightness, Blue light filter, Dark mode, a choice between Vivid and Natural display colours, Always On Display, Accidental touch protection, Touch Sensitivity and more. While all the display features prove to be helpful, the accidental touch protection doesn’t really provide any protection as the device could easily be accessed accidentally.. Finally I will suggest others to buy this mobile because of the excellent functionality and features",5.0 out of 5 stars

Especially if you are a gamer, a whooping 9 and half hour gaming is provided in this awesome phone. Fingerprint reader is also very fast and the face sensor is prompt. I recommend this phone to everyone as it is an overpowered phone for a nice budget.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Stock android would have been great had to uninstall a lot of unnecessary applications otherwise UI is great and oh the battery life this baby could last ages long battery life one full charge and this will last all day even with heavy usages one con is the heating issues the cpu throttles a lot if u put it to work maybe because they dont use thermal paste and use some sort of padding to take the heat away from cpu which doesnt do its job efficiently",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reddish (especially in selfie cam) . If you take a photo using the rear camera and zoom-in, the image would look smudged. Not at all sharp. Also, poor low-light photography.. 2) Extremely poor video stabilization.. 3) Bad UI.. 4) Yellowish tint on the screen.. 5) If you look at the screen from a different angle, colour would change a lot..

M31 rocks in this price segment with its display quality and relatively better camera then others. the camera quality is much better than others wrt to clarity and details it preserve and photos doesn't seem to be over saturated and edited like other brands do. battery is beast and processor is good. only one drawback for all samsung phones that it stops giving software updates within a year or so and hence people who are genuinely concerned with security of the phone are in the back seat. overall good buy.,5.0 out of 5 stars

2831,Reviewed in India on 7 August 2020,Mahi Pawar ,Best mobile .....😘😘😘  Read comment carefully,Guys its a really very good product... But my personal opinion is that instead of buying 6 64 you should buy 6 128. As most people says that front camera is not good but also its not to bad. Remember this mobile doesn't have private space for hidding photos and all. Also don't have app lock. One best thing in this mobile is that it has many more features than other mobiles. So you can blindly go for it. You can use your mobile continuously for more than 24 hrs without charging full nonstop. Best thing of this mobile is its display and keyboard . Keyboard is very sensitive . Also mobile values best for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars

After switching over to the M31 from the Motorola G5s, the display simply blew me away. the colors are really vivid, and you really enjoy watching content on this device. another huge aspect that was important for me was the battery. 6000 mah is no joke and Samsung has done an excellent job of putting this in a package without driving the prices up. one big difference switching from the G5s was the size and weight but I got used to it within a couple of dates. The quality of the product is really impressive, I recommend it wholeheartedly.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Well you are getting a 6000mAH battery in this one, one shouldn't be complaining about the battery life atleast. The cons of this phone is that Samsung should have given a higher watt fast charger which is only 15 watt fast charging and the back side of the phone gets scratches all over it if you clean the phone with a soft cotton cloth only. The backside would have been much better if they have used glass. All over the phone is best in this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2973,Reviewed in India on 18 December 2020,Mane,Poor camera and fast issue,Samsung has given fake news regarding camera and phone speed. Camera quality is not up to the standards and speed is average. Both are very major issues foe every user. They claimed 64 mega pixel camera but if we take a picture we won't feel even it is 12 mega pixel and processor is his own. Speed is major issue .

2975,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2020,Rach,My 1st EVER Samsung phone - Galaxy M31,Pros:-. Long battery life with faster charging.. Camera quality as per reputation that goes with Samsung Smartphones. Full screen to body ratio is the best in this league and great picture quality for media viewing.. So far dropped my phone twice in one month and is working fine. Screen is water (and soap 😝) resistant so the body of the phone is pretty rough and tough. 💪🏼. With a 6GB RAM and snapdragon 736 the processor is pretty good for gamers! 🎮. Cons:-. The only problem I personally dislike is software update demands and apps other than simple stock Android.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Its battery charges in 4.5 hours. It lasts more than 1 day. But thinking about 6000 Mah battery it isn't good enough. My Redmi Note 7's 4000 Mah battery charges in 80 minutes and lasts full day.. Charging speed and selfie camera issue needs to be sorted out in next update.. Everything else is satisfactory.. Update: after almost 25 days of usage I find battery amazing.

And with the amoled display you can enjoy the best video experience. Also with the mega battery if you are not a heavy user your charge can last long 2 and half days which is quite big for such a huge screen phone. But one thing I'm not satisfied is the face unlock it's quite a bit slow even sometime doesn't recognize your face also. But overall it's a money worthy purchase and if you don't wanna use Chinese phone this can be a best deal for you.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Coming to the camera quality, 64 MP camera, it clicks pictures beyond your expectation. The colours seem natural and when you zoom into the pictures you can feel 64 MP.. The only disappointing thing about camera is that Night modes get distorted a lot of times. And even the macro camera didn't perform that good.. Fingerprint sensor is fast but I have faced few issues where it would not respond unless I awake the screen by clicking power button.. Battery life is which stands out in features as it says 6000 mAH. But I am very disappointed about it as after using for almost a week. Even though 6000 mAH, it just feels like I am using a 3500 mAH battery phone. I feel it is the problem with Exynos 9611 processor as it is not optimized. But still you can use the phone for one whole day with playing few games and movies. But with normal usage you can go up to 1 and half day..

M31 offers One UI 2.0 (based on Android 10) which is out-of-the-box.. A smooth Android skin, it works well on most Samsung smartphones and has a few nifty features – Always-On Display, Ultra Data Saving, and Dual Messenger – that add to the package.. 6.4 full hd Super Amoled display is just Amazing which I couldn't find in other phones in this segment. It gives an enriched experience while watching Netflix or prime. It supports 4K as well.. The colours are vibrant and punchy and the text is sharp and the sunlight legibility is also quite good.. It has a 6000mah mega monster battery which I love the most. Easily it last for 1.5 or 2 days. And it takes 2.5 hours or less for full charging. Trust me I use my phone for around 12-15 hours a day. With this monstar battery, phone doesn't seem heavyweight. Well done! Samsung. The Samsung Galaxy M31 consists of a 64-megapixel primary sensor, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a 5-megapixel macro sensor, and a 5-megapixel depth camera, which produce great results in day-time. The images captured by the 64-megapixel sensor have good details and great dynamic range. 32 MP selfie camera is amazing.. It supports slow motion, live focus as well. Overall phone is awesome.

The best thing is having a battery of 6000mah but still it's light in weight. Specially people who are looking for a Non-Chinese mobile, this is the one you can go with.

The Battery is draining a bit fast while using mobile data or Wifi ! Overall I would rate this phone 4 out of 5 stars ! Thank you for this amazing product !

3518,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,Rupshikha,Not really good.,Camera quality is really good. Its amazing .. But the major issue is Heating problem. And its too much. After clicking 4-5 photos it starts heating. Pathetic condition. You cant talk continuously for 15minutes due to its heating problem. Samsung really need to update this phone. With all the specification in the reasonable budget samsung cant manage it well. And battery backup is not good. It can give hardly 10 hrs backup if you are not a heavy user. Again it takes 3hrs to get fully charged.,3.0 out of 5 stars

3810,Reviewed in India on 27 May 2020,arpeet,It is a monster but not in all areas,After using this phone over 3months you can totally relly on it's battery back up. Rear camera is best at this price segment but front camera didn't deserve much appreciation. Samsung has to work on it's software functions to improve the speed and multi tasking accessibility which 6GB RAM can handle easily. Heating issues can be faced in daily routine but one of the greatest thing is phone didn't feel much heavy and it's weight balance is awesome.. Overall you can't deny to buy this one at this price point.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Make sure you change the setting to 64 before click.. Battery backup is phenominal. Great display you can get at this price. Black varient is more classy. Fingerprint and faceunlock works flawlessly. For me 6000 mah came 3 days for normal usage. Android 10 and one UI 2.0 out of the box is a great plus. Software is more fluid and fast.. Multitasking is very good.
